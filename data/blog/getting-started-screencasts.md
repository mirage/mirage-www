We put together some quick screencasts to make it easier for people to get
started with MirageOS. They're all in a playlist below, which is around 10
minutes in total.

There are currently 4 videos which walk through some of the typical steps.
The first three cover installation, building a 'hello world', and building a
Xen unikernel on an Ubuntu machine. The fourth video gives an overview of the
development workflows that are possible with OPAM and Git.

These should give everyone a clear idea of what it's like to work with the
tools before leaping in and installing things!

If anyone would like to help us make more of these screencasts, please do get
in touch on the [mailing list][list] — I've also listed it as one of our many
[Pioneer Projects][pioneer]!
