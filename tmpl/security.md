It's important to consider the process of disclosing issues to us. Many bugs
can be reported as usual on our [issue tracker][issues], but public forums are
sometimes inappropriate for reporting security issues.

If you think you've discovered a **security vulnerability**, the best way to
inform us is to send us an email to **security [at] mirage.io**.  One of the
team will respond and we will take it from there.

A OpenPGP key is [available from the keyservers](http://keys.mayfirst.org/pks/lookup?op=get&fingerprint=on&search=0x4A732D757C0EDA74), its fingerprint is `23B2 822C 89A9 EC73 C7DF  0748 4A73 2D75 7C0E DA74`.
