### mirage-xen-minios-v0.7.0: Disable stack protection on x86_64

Released on 2015-02-12 as [v0.7.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/releases/tag/v0.7.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios> for full history.

Stack protection doesn't work yet on x86_64, so explicitly disable it to prevent boot-time crashes on systems that enable it by default on their host toolchains (like Ubuntu).

### ocaml-magic-mime-v1.0.0: Initial public release

Released on 2015-02-08 as [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-magic-mime/releases/tag/v1.0.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-magic-mime> for full history.

This library contains a database of MIME types that maps filename extensions
into MIME types suitable for use in many Internet protocols such as HTTP or
e-mail.  It is generated from the `mime.types` file found in Unix systems, but
has no dependency on a filesystem since it includes the contents of the
database as an ML datastructure.


### ocaml-cow-v1.2.0: Now with valid HTML5 Output

Released on 2015-02-06 as [v1.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow/releases/tag/v1.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow> for full history.

### irmin-0.9.3: 

Released on 2015-02-04 as [0.9.3](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases/tag/0.9.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/irmin> for full history.

* Fix the invalidation of the view caches (report by @gregtatcam).
  This was causing some confusing issues where views' sub-keys where
  not properly updated to to their new values when the view is merged
  back to the store. The issues is a regression introduced in 0.9.0.
* Add post-commit hooks for the HTTP server.
* Add `Irmin.watch_tags` to monitor tag creation and desctructions.
* Fix `Irmin.push`
* Add `Irmin.with_hrw_view` to easily use transactions.
* Add a phantom type to `Irmin.t` to denote the store capabilities
  read-only, read-write or branch-consistent.
* The `~old` argument of a merge function can now be optional to
  signify that there is no common ancestor.
* Expose `Irmin.with_rw_view` to create a temporary, in-memory and
  mutable view of the store. This can be used to perform atomic
  operations in the store (ie. non-persistent transactions).
* Simplify the view API again
* Expose the task of previous commits. This let the user access
  the Git timestamp and other info such as the committer name (#90)
* The user-defined merge functions now takes an `unit -> 'a result
  Lwt.t` argument for `~old` (instead of `'a`). Evalutating the
  function will compute the least-common ancestors. Merge functions
  which ignore the `old` argument don't have to pay the cost of
  computing the lcas anymore.
* Expose `S.lcas` to get the least common ancestors
* Update to ocaml-git 1.4.6

### ezjsonm-0.4.1: avoid manual coercion 

Released on 2015-02-04 as [0.4.1](https://github.com/mirage/ezjsonm/releases/tag/0.4.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/ezjsonm> for full history.

* Fix LRU cache: SHA1 should be unique in the cache (regression
  introduced in 1.4.3). This was causing confusing read results
  under load.
* Reading objects now updates the LRU cache
* Fix a regression in `ogit cat-file` which were displaying nothing
  for small objects.


### ocaml-git-1.4.7: Fix for non-bare repositories, remove stdout/stderr messages

* Fix the filesystem updates for non-bare repositories (reported by @avsm)
* `Git.write_index` now takes an optional `index` argument
* Index entries should be fixed alphabetically
* Remove raw printf (#60)
* More flexibility on where to write temp files. The directory name can be
  configured by write calls, and the default is `OGITTMPDIR` if set,
  then `Filename.get_temp_dir_name` -- as it was in 1.4.5, see #51


### ocaml-nocrypto-0.3.1: The Ditch-Your-OS minor

Released on 2015-02-01 as [0.3.1](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto/releases/tag/0.3.1). See <https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto> for full history.

* Fixed destroy, which previously would overwrite the entry with
  uninitialised data, which might not set the deleted flag.
* Require only `get_buf` from `IO_PAGE`
* Fix travis.
* test: use OUnit's arg parser.
* return errors from size rather than raising Fs_error.

### ocaml-cstruct-v1.6.0: Add `fillv` function

Released on 2015-01-29 as [v1.6.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct/releases/tag/v1.6.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct> for full history.

### io-page-v1.4.0: Add Cstruct to Io_page conversion function

Released on 2015-01-28 as [v1.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/io-page/releases/tag/v1.4.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/io-page> for full history.

* Add `of_cstruct_exn` as a safe way to turn a Cstruct back into an `Io_page.t`.
* Expose `page_size` constant in interface.


### ocaml-vchan-v2.0.2: Support the Io_page 1.3.0 interface

Released on 2015-01-27 as [v2.0.2](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan/releases/tag/v2.0.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan> for full history.

The `io-page` 1.3.0 API changed the type of the page to be private, and so this library now ensures that it allocates the grant pages via Io_page.  This is backwards compatible with older versions of Io_page.

### mirage-net-unix-v2.1.0: Support for Io_page 1.3.0

Released on 2015-01-27 as [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-unix/releases/tag/v2.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-unix> for full history.

### mirage-platform-v2.2.1: Fix modern GCC and Xen compilation

Released on 2015-01-27 as [v2.2.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.2.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

Fix Xen compilation with `gcc 4.8+` by disabling the stack protector and `-fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns` (not compatible with MiniOS).  These missing flags were a regression from 2.1.3, which did include them.

### ocaml-conduit-v0.7.2: Add error message display function

Released on 2015-01-27 as [v0.7.2](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/releases/tag/v0.7.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit> for full history.

* Add an `error_message` function to simplify error display (#38).
* Improvements to documentation (#37).

### io-page-v1.3.0: Make the `Io_page.t` type private 

Released on 2015-01-26 as [v1.3.0](https://github.com/mirage/io-page/releases/tag/v1.3.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/io-page> for full history.

* Make `Io_page.t` type private. Otherwise, any old array of bytes can be used as an `Io_page.t`. (#14)
* Switch to using the `Bytes` module instead of `String`.

### ocaml-dns-v0.13.0: Improved multicast DNS support

Released on 2015-01-26 as [v0.13.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns/releases/tag/v0.13.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns> for full history.

* Add support for multicast DNS (RFC6762) in the trie. (#35 from Luke Dunstan)
  * mDNS doesn't use SOA nor delegation (RFC 6762 section 12), so some minor changes
    to Trie are required to handle this.
  * mDNS doesn't echo the questions in the response (RFC 6762 section 6), except
    in legacy mode, so a `bool` argument was added to `Query.response_of_answer`.
  * `Query.answer` still exists but now `Query.answer_multiple` is also available
    for answering multiple questions in one query to produce a single answer
    (RFC 6762 section 5.3). One caveat is that responses may exceed the maximum
    message length, but that is not really specific to mDNS. Also, in theory multiple
    questions might require multiple separate response messages in unusual cases,
    but that is complicated and the library does not deal with that yet.
  * `Query.answer_multiple` takes an optional function to allow the caller to control
    the `cache-flush` bit. This bit is only set for records that have been "confirmed
    as unique". Using a callback requires minimal changes here but puts the burden of
    maintaining uniqueness state elsewhere.
  * `Query.answer_multiple` takes an optional function to filter the answer, in order
    to support "known answer suppression" (RFC 6762 section 7.1). Again, using a callback
    requires minimal change to the core, but later on the mDNS-specific known answer
    suppression logic could move into the `Query` module if that turns out to be simpler.
  * A query for `PTR` returns additional records for `SRV` and `TXT`, to support efficient
    service discovery.
  * `Trie.iter` was added to support mDNS announcements.
* Switch to `Bytes` instead of `String` for eventual `-safe-string` support.
* Partially remove some error printing to stderr. (#36)

Unit tests were added for some of the changes above, including a test-only
dependency on `pcap-format`.


### mirage-net-xen-v1.3.0: Page pooling and stability fixes under high receive load

Released on 2015-01-24 as [v1.3.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/releases/tag/v1.3.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen> for full history.

* When waiting for space in the transmit queue, we would sometimes fail
  to notice when space became available. (#15)
* Copy out-bound data into pre-shared pages for performance, security
  and simplicity. (#17)
* Use a centrally sourced Travis file and test OCaml 4.02+ as well.


### ocaml-vchan-v2.0.1: Improve configure script and error message functionality

Released on 2015-01-24 as [v2.0.1](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan/releases/tag/v2.0.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan> for full history.

* add an `error_message` function to convert a Vchan error
  into a human-readable string. (#60)
* Improve error messages from the `configure` output (#61).
* Use modern centrally sourced Travis script for OPAM 1.2.

### mirage-platform-v2.2.0: Add support for OCaml 4.02+ in Xen

Released on 2015-01-23 as [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

This releases adds support for OCaml 4.02+ compilation, and changes the Xen
backend build for Mirage significantly by:

* removing the OCaml compiler runtime from the mirage-platform, which makes
  it simpler to work across multiple revisions of the compiler.  It now uses
  the `ocaml-src` OPAM package to grab the current switch's version of the
  OCaml runtime.
* split the Xen runtime build into discrete `pkg-config` libraries:
  * `mirage-xen-posix.pc` : in the `xen-posix/` directory, is the nano-posix
     layer built with no knowledge of OCaml
  * `mirage-xen-minios.pc`: defines the `__INSIDE_MINIOS__` macro to expose
     internal state via the MiniOS headers (for use only by libraries that
     know exactly what they are doing with the MiniOS)
  * `mirage-xen-ocaml.pc`: in `xen-ocaml/core/`, this builds the OCaml asmrun,
     Bigarray and Str bindings using the `mirage-xen-posix` layer.
  * `mirage-xen-ocaml-bindings.pc`: in `xen-ocaml/bindings/`, these are bindings
     required by the OCaml libraries to MiniOS.  Some of the bindings use MiniOS
     external state and hence use `mirage-xen-minios`, whereas others
    (`cstruct_stubs` and `barrier_stubs` are just OCaml bindings and so just
    use `mirage-xen-posix`).
  * `mirage-xen.pc`: depends on all the above to provide the same external
    interface as the current `mirage-platform`.

The OCaml code is now built using OASIS, since the C code is built entirely
separately and could be moved out into a separate OPAM package entirely.


### mirage-console-v2.1.1: Add an `error_message` for console messages

Released on 2015-01-23 as [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-console/releases/tag/v2.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-console> for full history.

### mirage-platform-v2.1.3: Improved reporting of top-level errors in Xen backend

Released on 2015-01-23 as [v2.1.3](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.1.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

* [xen] Fix error handling in `OS.Main.run` to enable a top-level
  exception to signal to the Xen toolstack that it crashed (versus a
  clean exit). This in turn lets `on_crash="preserve"` behaviour work
  better in Xen VM description files.
* Remove `mirage-xen.pc` file on uninstall.


### irmin-0.9.2: 0.9.0 bug-fix

Released on 2015-01-19 as [0.9.2](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases/tag/0.9.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/irmin> for full history.

* Fix `S.of_head` for the HTTP client (regression introduced in 0.9.0)
* Fix regression in displaying the store's graph over HTTP introduced by
  0.9.0.
* Fix regression in watch handling introduced in 0.9.0.
* Fix regressions in `Views` introduced in 0.9.0. (thx @buzzheavyyear for
  the report)
* Always add a commit when calling a update function (`Irmin.update`
  `Irmin.remove`, `Irmin.remove_rec`) even if the contents' store have
  not changed.
* The [head] argument of [Git_unix.config] now has a proper type.
* Expose synchronisation functions for basic Irmin stores.
* The user-provided merge function now takes optional values. The
  function is now called much more often during recursive merges
  (even if one of the 3 buckets of the 3-way merge function is not
  filled -- in that case, it uses `None`).
* Also expose the type of the keys in the type basic Irmin stores. Use
  `('key, 'value) Irmint.t` instead of `'value Irmin.t`.
* The user-defined `merge` functions now take the current filename being
  merged as an additional argument.
* The user-defined `Contents` should expose a `Path` sub-module. Keys of
  the resulting Irmin store will be of type `Path.t`.
* Fix `irmin init --help`. (#103)


### ocaml-git-1.4.5: Support packed references

Released on 2015-01-19 as [1.4.5](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/releases/tag/1.4.5). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git> for full history.

  Skip the invalid filenames and continue. Users are expected to sanitize
  their filenames if they want to use a non-bare repository (#11)
* Overwrite changed file when expanding the index into the filesystem (#4)
* Do not recompute the hash of blob files when expanding the index into the
  filesystem. This help fixing a speed issue with non-bare repo with lots of
  file.
* Rename `{write,read}_cache` to `{write,read}_index`
* Rename Cache to Index
* Expose the protocol capabilities to the client
* Support side-band-64k protocol capability (#44)

* Lwt 2.4.7 renamed `blit_bytes_string` to `blit_to_bytes`, so depend
  on the newer API now. (#230)
* Use `cmdliner` in all of the Lwt client and server binaries.  This gives
  `cohttp-lwt-server` a nice Unix-like command-line interface now that
  can be viewed with the `--help` option. (#218 via Runhang Li)
* Improve `oasis` constraints and regenerate `opam` file (#229 via
  Christophe Troestler).

It's all about evolution, not revolution with this one.

Even though it's solstice.

### ocaml-nocrypto-0.3.0: Break-my-API Christmas special

Released on 2014-12-22 as [0.3.0](https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto/releases/tag/0.3.0). See <https://github.com/mirleft/ocaml-nocrypto> for full history.

This one is mostly about breaking your API.

With a bit of luck, name clashes with the other libs are gone.

### mirage-platform-v2.1.2: Further Xen/MiniOS header cleanup

Released on 2014-12-21 as [v2.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.1.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

Released on 2014-12-19 as [v0.0.9](https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga/releases/tag/v0.0.9). See <https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga> for full history.

Add compatibility with Cohttp 0.14.x APIs.

### ocaml-github-v0.9.4: Add bindings for organisation teams and repositories

Released on 2014-12-19 as [v0.9.4](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github/releases/tag/v0.9.4). See <https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github> for full history.

* Add bindings for organisation teams and repositories (#45).
* Use `Bytes` instead of `String` for future `safe-string` support.
* Use the Cohttp 0.14.0 API in the test cases and make them optional
  (activate with `--enable-tests` during configure).
* Add a `--json` option to `git-list-releases` so that it can emit
  the release information in JSON rather than Markdown.


### mirage-tcpip-v2.2.0: Add IPv6 stack

Released on 2014-12-18 as [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/releases/tag/v2.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip> for full history.


Add IPv6 support. This changeset minimises interface changes to the existing
`STACKV4` interfaces to faciliate a progressive merge.  The only visible
interface changes are:

* `IPV4.set_ipv4_*` functions have been renamed `IPV4.set_ip_*` because they
  are shared between IPV4 and IPV6.
* `IPV4.get_ipv4` and `get_ipv4_netmask` now return a `list` of `Ipaddr.V4.t`
  (again because this is the common semantics with IPV6.)
* Several types that had `v4` in their names (like `IPV4.ipv4addr`) have lost
  that particle.


### mirage-v2.2.0: Add IPv6 support to the type definitions

Released on 2014-12-18 as [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v2.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage> for full history.

Add IPv6 support, from Nicolas Ojeda Bar. This alters some of the interfaces that were previously hardcoded to IPv4 by generalising them.  For example:

```
type v4
type v6

type 'a ip
type ipv4 = v4 ip
type ipv6 = v6 ip
```

Full support for configuring IPv6 does not exist yet, as this release is
intended for getting the type definitions in place before adding configuration
support.


### ocaml-cohttp-v0.14.0: Simplify server interface

Released on 2014-12-18 as [v0.14.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/releases/tag/v0.14.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp> for full history.

Compatibility breaking interface changes:
* Simplify the Lwt server signature, so that manual construction of
  a `callback` is no longer required (#210).
  Code that previous looked like:

```
   let conn_closed (_,conn_id) () = <...>
   let config = { Server.callback; conn_closed } in
```

should now be:

```
   let conn_closed (_,conn_id) = <...>
   let config = Server.make ~callback ~conn_closed () in
```

* Remove the `Cohttp.Base64` module in favour of the external `base64`
  library (which is now a new dependency).

New features and bug fixes:
* Lwt `respond_error` now defaults to an internal server error if no
  status code is specified (#212).
* Modernise the `opam` file using the OPAM 1.2 workflow (#211).
* Flush the response body to the network by default, rather than
  buffering by default.  The `?flush` optional parameter can still
  be explicitly set to false if flushing is not desired (#205).


### ezjsonm-0.4.0: Add intXX combinatores, bug fixes for option and unit types

Released on 2014-12-17 as [0.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/ezjsonm/releases/tag/0.4.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ezjsonm> for full history.

* Clean-up the typed representation of serializable JSON
    (#5, report and patch from Rudi Grinberg)
* add int32/int64/triple combinators
* fix a bug with the option types
* fix the type of the `unit` combinator

### mirage-net-xen-v1.2.0: Add profile tracing to Netfront

Released on 2014-12-17 as [v1.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/releases/tag/v1.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen> for full history.

* Add profiling tracepoints and labels (#13).  Introduces a dependency on `mirage-profile`.
* New `opam` file present in source repository for OPAM 1.2 workflow.


### mirage-platform-v2.1.1: Add header definitions for Ctypes support

Released on 2014-12-17 as [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

* Remove checksum stubs from Unix and Xen, as they are provided by `tcpip` now.
* [xen] Define UINTx_MAX and SIZE_MAX in stdint.h, which is sufficient to let Ctypes compile (ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes#231)


### ocaml-git-1.4.2: Fix writing of empty files

Released on 2014-12-14 as [1.4.2](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/releases/tag/1.4.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git> for full history.

### mirage-profile-v0.4: mirage-profile 0.4

Released on 2014-12-12 as [v0.4](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile/releases/tag/v0.4). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile> for full history.

- Add signal support (to see interactions with `Lwt_condition`s).
- Don't break the build when new events are added to Lwt.

### mirage-tcpip-v2.1.1: Improved DHCP logging

Released on 2014-12-12 as [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/releases/tag/v2.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip> for full history.

### mirage-trace-viewer-v0.1: mirage-trace-viewer 0.1

Released on 2014-12-12 as [v0.1](https://github.com/talex5/mirage-trace-viewer/releases/tag/v0.1). See <https://github.com/talex5/mirage-trace-viewer> for full history.

Intial release, with support for:
* Reading trace data from files, Unix processes and Xen guests.
* Displaying traces using GTK or JavaScript.
* Saving traces to a file or stdout.

### mirage-v2.1.1: Improve Xen linking, MacOS X compilation and build times

Released on 2014-12-10 as [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v2.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage> for full history.

* Do not reuse the Unix linker options when building Xen unikernels.  Instead,
  get the linker options from the ocamlfind `xen_linkopts` variables (#332).
  See `tcpip.2.1.0` for a library that does this for a C binding.
* Only activate MacOS X compilation by default on 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.
  Older revisions of MacOS X will use the generic Unix mode by default, since
  the `vmnet` framework requires Yosemite or higher.
* Do not run crunched filesystem modules through `camlp4`, which significantly
  speeds up compilation on ARM platforms (from minutes to seconds!) (#299).


### mirage-v2.1.0: Specific target support for MacOS X, and bug fixes for builds

Released on 2014-12-07 as [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v2.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage> for full history.

* Add specific support for `MacOSX` as a platform, which enables network bridging
  on Yosemite (#329).  The `--unix` flag will automatically activate the new target
  if run on a MacOS X host.  If this breaks for you due to being on an older version of
  MacOS X, then use the new `--target` flag to set either Unix, MacOSX or Xen to the
  `mirage configure` command.
* Add `mirage.runtime` findlib library and corresponding Mirage_runtime module (#327).
* If net driver in STACKV4_direct can't initialize, print a helpful error (#164).
* [xen]: fixed link order in generated Makefile (#322).
* Make `Lwt.tracing` instructions work for Fish shell too by improving quoting (#328).

### mirage-tcpip-v2.1.0: Add profile tracing, and better Xen stub compilation

Released on 2014-12-07 as [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/releases/tag/v2.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip> for full history.

* Build Xen stubs separately, with `CFLAGS` from `mirage-xen` 2.1.0+.
  This allows us to use the red zone under x86_64 Unix again.
* Adding tracing labels and counters, which introduces a new dependency on the
  `mirage-profile` package.

### mirage-platform-v2.1.0: Add Xen tracing and improve packaging of C runtime

Released on 2014-12-07 as [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

* [xen] Report trace events for GC, block_domain, XenStore and event channels.
  This introduces a new dependency on the `mirage-profile` package.
* [xen] Install a `pkg-config` file to allow other projects to compile C stubs
  against `mirage-xen`.
* [xen] Remove duplication of OCaml header files inside the `include` tree.

### mirage-profile-v0.3: mirage-profile 0.3

Released on 2014-12-06 as [v0.3](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile/releases/tag/v0.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile> for full history.

- Removed C stubs for adding timestamp on Xen. Use the new monotonic time support in mirage-xen instead.

- Use a monotonic clock on OS X (David Scott). OS X doesn't have `clock_gettime` so we use something OS X-specific.


### mirage-tcpip-v2.0.3: Remove ARP race condition and simplify DHCP client

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v2.0.3](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/releases/tag/v2.0.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip> for full history.

* Fixed race waiting for ARP response (#86).
* Move the the code that configures IPv4 address, netmask and gateways
  after receiving a successful lease out of the `Dhcp_clientv4` module
  and into `Stackv4` (#87)

### mirage-platform-v2.0.1: Xen stability: use monotonic time, check for page aligned I/O and add assert stubs

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v2.0.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/releases/tag/v2.0.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform> for full history.

* [xen] Assert that pages passed to the grant share API are page-aligned.
  This always happens if they are created via `Io_page.create`, and
  probably not true if made by `Cstruct.create`.
* [xen] Use monotonic time for timing events, not wall-clock time.
* [xen] Provide functions that C code often uses for asserts (`abort`,
  `printf`, etc).

### ocaml-cohttp-v0.13.0: Support for the pure OCaml TLS stack in HTTP clients and servers

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v0.13.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/releases/tag/v0.13.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp> for full history.

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

* Add sexp converters for Conduit contexts and `Lwt` client and server
  modules and module types.

New Features and bug fixes:
* Can use the Conduit 0.7+ `CONDUIT_TLS=native` environment variable to
  make HTTPS requests using the pure OCaml TLS stack instead of depending
  on OpenSSL bindings.  All of the installed binaries (client and server)
  can work in this mode.
* Add `Cohttp_lwt_unix_debug` which lets libraries control the debugging
  output from Cohttp.  Previously the only way to do this was to set the
  `COHTTP_DEBUG` environment variable at the program start.
* Add `cohttp-curl-lwt` as a lightweight URI fetcher from the command-line.
  It uses the `cmdliner` as a new dependency.
* Remove build dependency check on `lwt.ssl` for `cohttp.lwt`.
  This has been moved to conduit, so only `lwt.unix` is needed here now.


### mirage-http-v2.1.0: Expose sexp converters for HTTP contexts

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-http/releases/tag/v2.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-http> for full history.

* Use the Conduit 0.7+ resolver API (provide `of_sexp` for context).
* Do not link against `camlp4` in the `META` file and only use it during build.

### ocaml-conduit-v0.7.1: Reduce debug logging by default

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v0.7.1](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/releases/tag/v0.7.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit> for full history.

* Do not emit debug output when the `CONDUIT_DEBUG` variable is not set.
* Do not create symlinks in a local build, which helps with OPAM pins.
* Improve ocamldoc for `Conduit_lwt_unix`.

### mirage-profile-v0.2: mirage-profile 0.2

Released on 2014-12-05 as [v0.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile/releases/tag/v0.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-profile> for full history.

* Now supports OCaml 4.00 (doesn't use O_CLOEXEC)
* Adds support for labelled Lwt mvars

### ocaml-conduit-v0.7.0: Add native OCaml-TLS support

Released on 2014-12-04 as [v0.7.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit/releases/tag/v0.7.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-conduit> for full history.

* Add Lwt-unix support for the native OCaml/TLS stack as an alternative
  to OpenSSL. This can be activated by setting the `CONDUIT_TLS` environment
  variable to `native`.  If this is not set and OpenSSL is available, then
  OpenSSL is used by in preference to the pure OCaml implementation.
* Add sexp convertors for `Conduit_lwt_unix.ctx` and `Conduit_mirage.ctx`
  and the `Resolver` service types.
* Fix the Mirage tests to the Mirage 2.0.1+ Conduit interfaces.
* Add more debugging output when the `CONDUIT_DEBUG` variable is set on Unix.
* *Interface breaking:* The `client` and `server` types in `Conduit_lwt_unix`
  now explicitly label the fields of the tuples with a polymorphic variant.
  This allows them to remain independent of this library but still be
  more self-descriptive (i.e. `Port of int` instead of just `int`).

### mirage-net-macosx-v1.0.0: Initial public release

Released on 2014-12-01 as [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-macosx/releases/tag/v1.0.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-macosx> for full history.

MacOS X implementation of the Mirage NETWORK interface.

This interface exposes raw Ethernet frames using the
[Vmnet](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vmnet) framework that
is available on MacOS X Yosemite onwards.  It is suitable for
use with an OCaml network stack such as the one found at
<https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip>.

For a complete system that uses this, please see the
[MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) homepage.


### ocaml-vmnet-v1.0.0: Initial public release

Released on 2014-12-01 as [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vmnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vmnet> for full history.

MacOS X 10.10 (Yosemite) introduced the somewhat undocumented `vmnet`
framework.  This exposes virtual network interfaces to userland applications.
There are a number of advantages of this over previous implementations:

- Unlike [tuntaposx](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/), this is builtin
  to MacOS X now and so is easier to package up and distribute for end users.
- `vmnet` uses the XPC sandboxing interfaces and should make it easier to
  drop a hard dependency on running networking applications as `root`.
- Most significantly, `vmnet` supports bridging network traffic to the
  outside world, which was previously unsupported.

These OCaml bindings are constructed against the documentation contained
in the `<vmnet.h>` header file in Yosemite, and may not be correct due to
the lack of any other example code.  However, they do suffice to run
[MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) applications that can connect to the
outside world.  The bindings are also slightly complicated by the need
to interface [GCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Dispatch)
thread pools with the OCaml runtime, so please report any instabilities
that you see when using this interface as a consumer.

There are two libraries provided:

- `Vmnet` is the raw OCaml binding to the `vmnet` framework, using
   OCaml preemptive threads to handle synchronisation.
- `Lwt_vmnet` uses the [Lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt) framework to
  provide a monadic asynchronous I/O interface at a higher level.

Most users should use `Lwt_vmnet` to handle guest traffic.

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

* Rename `Cohttp.Auth.t` to `Cohttp.Auth.credential` and `Cohttp.Auth.req`
  to `Cohttp.Auth.challenge`.  Also expose an `Other` variant
  to make it more extensible for unknown authentication types. The
  `Cohttp.Auth` functions using these types have also been renamed accordingly.
* Rename `Cohttp.Transfer.encoding_to_string` to `string_of_encoding`
  for consistency with the rest of Cohttp's APIs.
* The `has_body` function in the Request and Response modules now
  explicitly signals when the body size is unknown.
* Move all the module type signatures into `Cohttp.S`.
* If users have percent-encoded file names, their resolution is changed:
 `resolve_local_file` in `Cohttp_async` and `Cohttp_lwt` now always
  percent-decode paths (#157)
* Remove the `Cohttp_lwt.Server.server` type synonym to `t`.
* When reading data from a HTTP body stream using the `Fixed` encoding,
  we need to maintain state (bytes remaining) so we know when to finish.

  `reader` and `writer` types to track this safely.
* Add `is_empty` function to the `Cohttp.S.Body` module type.
* Add `Strings` representation to `Cohttp.Body` to efficiently hold a
  list of body chunks.
* Move flushing logic for HTTP bodies into the portable `Request` and
  `Response` modules instead of individual Lwt and Async backends.
* Port module interfaces to the latest Conduit (0.6.0+) API.
* Cohttp requires OCaml 4.01.0 or higher now.

New features and bugfixes:

* Add a `Cohttp_lwt_xhr` JavaScript backend that enables Cohttp logic to be
  mapped to `XMLHTTPRequest` in browsers via `js_of_ocaml` (via Andy Ray).
* Add a `Cohttp.String_io` and `String_io_lwt` module that uses OCaml
  `string` or `Buffer.t` to read and write HTTP requests and responses
  instead of network connections.
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now return better errors (#158)
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now serve indexes directly (#162)
* [lwt] Add `stop` thread to terminate a running server if it finishes (#147).

* Fix OCaml 4.02 compatibility by not exposing a `Location` module
  in syntax extensions to avoid a namespace clash. We now rename them
  to `Xml_location` and `Css_location` and pack those instead.
* Fix BSD compatibility using `$(MAKE)` instead of `make` (since the
  GNU make binary is actually `gmake` on Free/Net/OpenBSD).
* Reduce the verbosity of the build by default.
* Travis: Add OCaml 4.02 and OPAM 1.2.0 tests


### ocaml-mbr-v0.2: First Mirage release

Released on 2014-08-18 as [v0.2](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-mbr/releases/tag/v0.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-mbr> for full history.

  the standard Mirage block interface.
* use a polymorphic variant result type [`Ok of 'a | `Error of 'b]

### mirage-xen-minios-v0.3: Stability and performance improvements

Released on 2014-08-14 as [v0.3](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/releases/tag/v0.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios> for full history.

* Update to `openlibm-0.4` and `libminios-0.3`, which includes a larger stack size and stack overflow detection on ARM now.
* Build minios without debug mode by default, since this disabled all optimisations in earlier versions.

### ocaml-uri-v1.7.2: Functional mutator bug fixes

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v1.7.2](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-uri/releases/tag/v1.7.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-uri> for full history.

* Fix empty-but-existing query ("?") parsing bug
* Fix `with_userinfo` against hostless URI representation bug
* Fix `with_port` against hostless URI representation bug
* Fix `with_path` with relative path against hosted URI representation bug (#51)
* Fix `make` without host but with userinfo or port representation bug
* Fix `make` with host, userinfo, or port and relative path representation bug

In sum, the library will now try to guide the user to using an abstract value that is actually serializable.

### ocaml-cstruct-v1.4.0: Comprehensive bounds checking for all operations

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v1.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct/releases/tag/v1.4.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct> for full history.

Comprehensive addition of bounds checking to all cstruct operations (from @pqwy in #33).  The major API-facing changes are:
* Disallow negative indexing with all cstruct accessors.
* Disallow negative `sub` and `shift` operations.
* Make sure `of_bigarray` cannot create invalid `cstruct` values.

This may break some older `cstruct` consumers that assumed that negative shifts were allowed, and so the version has been bumped to 1.4.0.


### ocaml-cow-v0.10.1: Xml.of_string "" bugfix release

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v0.10.1](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow/releases/tag/v0.10.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow> for full history.

`Cow.Xml.of_string ""` was throwing `Invalid_argument` due to the assumption that the string to parse was not zero length in the check for a trailing ampersand. This release fixes that bug and turns debugging information on by default.

### ocaml-github-v0.8.6: Add git-create-release

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v0.8.6](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github/releases/tag/v0.8.6). See <https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github> for full history.

* Fix `pull_action_type` `synchronize` tag typo (#33 from Philipp Gesang).

Released on 2014-07-23 as [v1.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/releases/tag/v1.1.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen> for full history.

Wait for packets to be processed by the backend before returning from a `writev` call. Without this, the caller has no way to know when it's safe to reuse the buffer (#11).


### mirage-fs-unix-v1.1.1: Implement POSIX root directory semantics

Released on 2014-07-21 as [v1.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs-unix/releases/tag/v1.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs-unix> for full history.

Traversal outside of the exposed POSIX directory is now prohibited. Additionally, the root directory is now its own parent, i.e. `/../ -> /`.

* Raise exception `Bad_option` for unparseable or invalid TCPv4 options (#57).
* Fix linking error with module `Tcp_checksum` by lifting it into top library (#60).
* Add `opam` file to permit easier local pinning, and fix Travis to use this.


### mirage-xen-minios-v0.2: Initial public release

Released on 2014-07-18 as [v0.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/releases/tag/v0.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios> for full history.

This repository contains the scripts to install the library dependencies required
by the MirageOS Xen backend.  It contains:

* An unofficial fork of Mini-OS, a small operating system kernel that
  runs as a Xen guest. Mini-OS is part of Xen, but for convenience the
  non-Mini-OS parts have been deleted for this library.
  <https://github.com/talex5/xen/releases/tag/minios-v0.2>

* OpenLibM, from the upstream master, but forked in order to have a
  stable tag while waiting for an upstream release.
  <https://github.com/talex5/openlibm/releases/tag/v0.3.1-tal1>


### ocaml-vchan-v1.0.0: Stable release

Released on 2014-07-16 as [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan/releases/tag/v1.0.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan> for full history.

* test VM: uses the V1_LWT.FLOW signature


### shared-memory-ring-1.1.0: Interface now supports xenstore ring reconnection

Released on 2014-07-16 as [1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/shared-memory-ring/releases/tag/1.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/shared-memory-ring> for full history.

In order to reconnect to an existing (xenstore) ring after a restart we must avoid (i) removing data which we haven't persisted somewhere; and (ii) avoid writing the same chunk of data twice. We make this possible by exposing a 'type position' and using this in both 'read' and 'write'. The position represents the current offset in the data stream. The position is manually advanced by the client via the 'advance' function.

### cowabloga-v0.0.7: Support multiple authors

Released on 2014-07-12 as [v0.0.7](https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga/releases/tag/v0.0.7). See <https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga> for full history.

### mirage-v1.2.0: Simpler configuration and Entropy interface

Released on 2014-07-07 as [v1.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v1.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage> for full history.

The Mirage frontend tool now generates a Makefile with a `make depend`
target, instead of directly invoking OPAM as part of `mirage configure`.
This greatly improves usability on slow platforms such as ARM, since the
output of OPAM as it builds can be inspected more easily.  Users will now
need to run `make depend` to ensure they have the latest package set,
before building their unikernel with `make` as normal.

* Improve format of generated Makefile, and also colours in terminal output.
* Add `make depend` target to generated Makefile.
* Set `OPAMVERBOSE` and `OPAMYES` in the Makefile, which can be overridden.
* Add an `ENTROPY` device type for strong random sources (#256).

* Add bounds checks for `Cstruct.BE/LE` functions that violate a view.
  Previously, only bounds errors on the underlying buffers would raise.
  Bug #25, reported by Mindy Preston in mirage/mirage-tcpip#56.
* Add 'Lwt_cstruct.complete' to ensure that `read`/`write` operatiosn
  run to completion.
* Add `Sexplib` conversion functions to `Cstruct.t` values (#27 #22).

This is compatible with the `sexplib` convention.  The syntax is;

```
cenum foo64 {
  ONE64;
  TWO64;
  THREE64
} as uint64_t(sexp)
```

And `sexp_of_foo64` and `foo64_of_sexp` functions will also be available.
The representation of the Sexp is the string representation of the enum.

  shared datastore instead of creating a fresh one. Add
  `IrminMemory.Fresh` to return a fresh in-memory datastore maker.
* The HTTP server now outputs some nice graph (using dagre-d3). Don't
  expect to display very large graphs
* More friendly tag names in the Git backend (no need to prefix
  everything by `refs/heads/` anymore)
* Partial support for recursive stores (WIP)

  fork/join operations, IrminSnapshot for snapshot/revert
  operations and IrminDump for import/export operations.
  The later two implementation can be derived automaticaly
  from a base IrminBranch implementation. The update and merge
  operations are supported on each backend
* IrminGit does not depend on unix anymore and can thus be
  compile to javascript or xen with mirage
* No need to have bin_io converter for contents anymore
* No need to have JSON converter for contents anymore
* No more IrminDispatch
* Add an optional branch argument to Irmin.create to use

### irmin-0.7.0: Support for views, speed improvement

Released on 2014-05-02 as [0.7.0](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases/tag/0.7.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/irmin> for full history.

* Feature: support for in-memory transactions. They are built
  on top of views.
* Feature: add support for views: these are temporary stores with
  lazy reads + in-memory writes; they can be used to convert back
  and forth an OCaml value into a store, or to have a fast stagging
  area without the need to commit every operation to the store.
* Support custom messages in commit messages
* Improve the IrminMerge API
* Backend: add a 'dispatch' backend for combining multiple backends
  into one. This can be used to have a P2P store where there is
  well-defined mapping between keys and host (as a DHT).
* Fix: limit the number of simulteanous open files in the Git and
  the file-system backend
* Speed-up the in-memory store
* Speed-up the import/export codepath
* Speed-up the reads
* Speed-up IrminValue.Mux
* Deps: use ocaml-sha instead of cryptokit

### ocaml-cohttp-v0.10.0: Interface cleanups before a 1.0 release

Released on 2014-03-02 as [v0.10.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/releases/tag/v0.10.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp> for full history.

* Interface change: The `Request` and `Response` module types now explictly
  signal `Eof` and `Invalid` (for errors), to help the backend distinguish them.
* Interface change: Unify HTTP body handling across backends into a `Cohttp.Body`
  module.  This is extended by Async/Lwt implementations with their specific
  ways of handling bodies (Pipes for Async, or Lwt_stream for Lwt).
* [lwt] Interface change: HTTP client calls now raise Lwt exceptions rather
  than return an option type.  This permits better error handling in Lwt.
* [lwt] Interface change: The `Server` callback now always provides a `body`
  argument, since `Cohttp_lwt_body` now explicitly supports empty bodys.
* Add `Cohttp.Header.is_keep_alive` to test if a connection should be reused.
* [lwt] Respect the `keep-alive` header in the server request handling.
* [async] Add a `Body` that takes a `Pipe` or a `string`, similarly to Lwt.
* Install `cohttp-server` binary even if tests are disabled.
* Begin an `examples` directory with some simple uses of the library.

* Use `Ipaddr.V6` to restore IPv6/AAAA RR support.
* `process_query` now takes an output buffer so it doesn't have to
  overwrite the input buffer it just parsed.
* Add Travis continuous integration scripts.
* Regenerate with OASIS 0.4.1
* Split the `dns.lwt` into a portable `dns.lwt-core` that doesn't
  require Unix (from which a Mirage version can be built).  The only
  change to existing applications is that Unix-specific functions
  have shifted into `Dns_resolver_unix` or `Dns_server_unix`, with
  the module types for `PROCESSOR` and `CLIENT` unchanged.

The Mirage 1.1.0 release features a new combinator interface to make it easier to map device drivers in `config.ml` into concrete applications.  This breaks backwards compatibility with Mirage 1.0 configuration files, but the added benefit is significant, so we felt it was worthwhile.

The `types` directory also now contains the `V1` and `V1_LWT` module types used throughout the Mirage libraries.

### ocaml-mstruct-1.3.0: remove debug and duplicate bound checks in the hot path

Released on 2014-02-10 as [1.3.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-mstruct/releases/tag/1.3.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-mstruct> for full history.
