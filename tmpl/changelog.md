### mirage-xen-minios-v0.4.2: Add explicit section for boot loader

Released on 2014-11-21 as [v0.4.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/releases/tag/v0.4.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios> for full history.

This adds an explicit linker section for the boot code, meaning we can ensure it always appears at the start of the image without requiring minios.a to be first in the linker command, which in turn allows untangling the linker command generated by mirage. 

### ocaml-git-v1.4.0: Use latest Conduit API

Released on 2014-11-20 as [v1.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/releases/tag/v1.4.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git> for full history.

* Depend on `ocaml-hex`


### ocaml-github-v0.9.2: Improved log error messages

Released on 2014-11-09 as [v0.9.2](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github/releases/tag/v0.9.2). See <https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github> for full history.

### ocaml-cohttp-v0.12.0: Add JavaScript and StringIO backends, and numerous interface improvements

Released on 2014-11-07 as [v0.12.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/releases/tag/v0.12.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp> for full history.

Compatibility breaking interface changes:

* Rename `Cohttp.Auth.t` to `Cohttp.Auth.credential` and `Cohttp.Auth.req`
  to `Cohttp.Auth.challenge`.  Also expose an `Other` variant
  to make it more extensible for unknown authentication types. The
  `Cohttp.Auth` functions using these types have also been renamed accordingly.
* Rename `Cohttp.Transfer.encoding_to_string` to `string_of_encoding`
  for consistency with the rest of Cohttp's APIs.
* The `has_body` function in the Request and Response modules now
  explicitly signals when the body size is unknown.
* Move all the module type signatures into `Cohttp.S`.
* If users have percent-encoded file names, their resolution is changed:
 `resolve_local_file` in `Cohttp_async` and `Cohttp_lwt` now always
  percent-decode paths (#157)
* Remove the `Cohttp_lwt.Server.server` type synonym to `t`.
* When reading data from a HTTP body stream using the `Fixed` encoding,
  we need to maintain state (bytes remaining) so we know when to finish.
  The `Cohttp.Request` and `Cohttp.Response` interfaces now expose a
  `reader` and `writer` types to track this safely.
* Add `is_empty` function to the `Cohttp.S.Body` module type.
* Add `Strings` representation to `Cohttp.Body` to efficiently hold a
  list of body chunks.
* Move flushing logic for HTTP bodies into the portable `Request` and
  `Response` modules instead of individual Lwt and Async backends.
* Port module interfaces to the latest Conduit (0.6.0+) API.
* Cohttp requires OCaml 4.01.0 or higher now.

New features and bugfixes:

* Add a `Cohttp_lwt_xhr` JavaScript backend that enables Cohttp logic to be
  mapped to `XMLHTTPRequest` in browsers via `js_of_ocaml` (via Andy Ray).
* Add a `Cohttp.String_io` and `String_io_lwt` module that uses OCaml
  `string` or `Buffer.t` to read and write HTTP requests and responses
  instead of network connections.
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now return better errors (#158)
* `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` now serve indexes directly (#162)
* [lwt] Add `stop` thread to terminate a running server if it finishes (#147).
* Add `Cohttp.Connection.compare` to make ordering of connections possible.
* Add `Body.map` and `Body.as_pipe` to work with HTTP bodies more easily.
* Remove link-time dependency on camlp4 via META fixes (#127).
* Support HTTP methods and versions other than the standard ones. (#142).
* Improve `cohttp_server_lwt` and `cohttp_server_async` directory listings (#158)
* Fix `Cohttp_async.resolve_local_file` directory traversal vulnerability (#158)
* [async] In the Async server, do not close the Reader too early.
* [async] Close file descriptors more eagerly in the HTTP client (#167).
* Reduce thread allocation by replacing `return <const>` with `return_none`,
  `return_unit` or `return_nil`.

  in syntax extensions to avoid a namespace clash. We now rename them
  to `Xml_location` and `Css_location` and pack those instead.
* Fix BSD compatibility using `$(MAKE)` instead of `make` (since the
  GNU make binary is actually `gmake` on Free/Net/OpenBSD).

### ocaml-cstruct-v1.4.0: Comprehensive bounds checking for all operations

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v1.4.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct/releases/tag/v1.4.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cstruct> for full history.

Comprehensive addition of bounds checking to all cstruct operations (from @pqwy in #33).  The major API-facing changes are:
* Disallow negative indexing with all cstruct accessors.
* Disallow negative `sub` and `shift` operations.
* Make sure `of_bigarray` cannot create invalid `cstruct` values.

This may break some older `cstruct` consumers that assumed that negative shifts were allowed, and so the version has been bumped to 1.4.0.


### ocaml-cow-v0.10.1: Xml.of_string "" bugfix release

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v0.10.1](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow/releases/tag/v0.10.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow> for full history.

`Cow.Xml.of_string ""` was throwing `Invalid_argument` due to the assumption that the string to parse was not zero length in the check for a trailing ampersand. This release fixes that bug and turns debugging information on by default.

### ocaml-github-v0.8.6: Add git-create-release

Released on 2014-08-10 as [v0.8.6](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github/releases/tag/v0.8.6). See <https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github> for full history.

* Fix `pull_action_type` `synchronize` tag typo (#33 from Philipp Gesang).
* Add a `git create-release` to create a GitHub release, including binary assets
  (#32 from Markus Mottl).


### mirage-net-xen-v1.1.3: Restore parallel writes to net ring

Released on 2014-08-08 as [v1.1.3](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/releases/tag/v1.1.3). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen> for full history.

Revert the serialization in 1.1.2 as Xen/ARM (4.5 and backport to 4.4) has been fixed to support granting the same page multiple times. Backport is in https://github.com/mirage/xen-arm-builder.


### ocaml-ctypes-0.3.3: ocaml-ctypes 0.3.3

Released on 2014-08-01 as [0.3.3](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/releases/tag/0.3.3). See <https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes> for full history.

Released on 2014-07-23 as [v1.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen/releases/tag/v1.1.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen> for full history.

Wait for packets to be processed by the backend before returning from a `writev` call. Without this, the caller has no way to know when it's safe to reuse the buffer (#11).


### mirage-fs-unix-v1.1.1: Implement POSIX root directory semantics

Released on 2014-07-21 as [v1.1.1](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs-unix/releases/tag/v1.1.1). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-fs-unix> for full history.

Traversal outside of the exposed POSIX directory is now prohibited. Additionally, the root directory is now its own parent, i.e. `/../ -> /`.

### mirage-xen-minios-v0.2: Initial public release

Released on 2014-07-18 as [v0.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios/releases/tag/v0.2). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage-xen-minios> for full history.

This repository contains the scripts to install the library dependencies required
by the MirageOS Xen backend.  It contains:

* An unofficial fork of Mini-OS, a small operating system kernel that
  runs as a Xen guest. Mini-OS is part of Xen, but for convenience the
  non-Mini-OS parts have been deleted for this library.
  <https://github.com/talex5/xen/releases/tag/minios-v0.2>

* OpenLibM, from the upstream master, but forked in order to have a
  stable tag while waiting for an upstream release.
  <https://github.com/talex5/openlibm/releases/tag/v0.3.1-tal1>


### ocaml-vchan-v1.0.0: Stable release

Released on 2014-07-16 as [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan/releases/tag/v1.0.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan> for full history.

* test VM: uses the V1_LWT.FLOW signature


### shared-memory-ring-1.1.0: Interface now supports xenstore ring reconnection

Released on 2014-07-16 as [1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/shared-memory-ring/releases/tag/1.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/shared-memory-ring> for full history.

In order to reconnect to an existing (xenstore) ring after a restart we must avoid (i) removing data which we haven't persisted somewhere; and (ii) avoid writing the same chunk of data twice. We make this possible by exposing a 'type position' and using this in both 'read' and 'write'. The position represents the current offset in the data stream. The position is manually advanced by the client via the 'advance' function.

### cowabloga-v0.0.7: Support multiple authors

Released on 2014-07-12 as [v0.0.7](https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga/releases/tag/v0.0.7). See <https://github.com/mirage/cowabloga> for full history.

### mirage-v1.2.0: Simpler configuration and Entropy interface

Released on 2014-07-07 as [v1.2.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/releases/tag/v1.2.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/mirage> for full history.

The Mirage frontend tool now generates a Makefile with a `make depend`
target, instead of directly invoking OPAM as part of `mirage configure`.
This greatly improves usability on slow platforms such as ARM, since the
output of OPAM as it builds can be inspected more easily.  Users will now
need to run `make depend` to ensure they have the latest package set,
before building their unikernel with `make` as normal.

* Improve format of generated Makefile, and also colours in terminal output.
* Add `make depend` target to generated Makefile.
* Set `OPAMVERBOSE` and `OPAMYES` in the Makefile, which can be overridden.
* Add an `ENTROPY` device type for strong random sources (#256).

```
cenum foo64 {
  ONE64;
  TWO64;
  THREE64
} as uint64_t(sexp)
```

And `sexp_of_foo64` and `foo64_of_sexp` functions will also be available.
The representation of the Sexp is the string representation of the enum.

* Fix the behavior of `IrminMemory.Make` to return an hanlder to a
  shared datastore instead of creating a fresh one. Add
  `IrminMemory.Fresh` to return a fresh in-memory datastore maker.
* The HTTP server now outputs some nice graph (using dagre-d3). Don't
  expect to display very large graphs
* More friendly tag names in the Git backend (no need to prefix
  everything by `refs/heads/` anymore)
* Partial support for recursive stores (WIP)

### ocaml-git-1.1.0: Basic push support (unix only for now on)

Released on 2014-06-02 as [1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/releases/tag/1.1.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git> for full history.

  fork/join operations, IrminSnapshot for snapshot/revert
  operations and IrminDump for import/export operations.
  The later two implementation can be derived automaticaly
  from a base IrminBranch implementation. The update and merge
  operations are supported on each backend
* IrminGit does not depend on unix anymore and can thus be
  compile to javascript or xen with mirage
* No need to have bin_io converter for contents anymore

### irmin-0.7.0: Support for views, speed improvement

Released on 2014-05-02 as [0.7.0](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases/tag/0.7.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/irmin> for full history.

* Feature: support for in-memory transactions. They are built
  on top of views.
* Feature: add support for views: these are temporary stores with
  lazy reads + in-memory writes; they can be used to convert back
  and forth an OCaml value into a store, or to have a fast stagging
  area without the need to commit every operation to the store.
* Support custom messages in commit messages
* Improve the IrminMerge API
* Backend: add a 'dispatch' backend for combining multiple backends
  into one. This can be used to have a P2P store where there is
  well-defined mapping between keys and host (as a DHT).
* Fix: limit the number of simulteanous open files in the Git and
  the file-system backend
* Speed-up the in-memory store
* Speed-up the import/export codepath
* Speed-up the reads

### ocaml-cohttp-v0.10.0: Interface cleanups before a 1.0 release

Released on 2014-03-02 as [v0.10.0](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp/releases/tag/v0.10.0). See <https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp> for full history.

* Interface change: The `Request` and `Response` module types now explictly
  signal `Eof` and `Invalid` (for errors), to help the backend distinguish them.
* Interface change: Unify HTTP body handling across backends into a `Cohttp.Body`
  module.  This is extended by Async/Lwt implementations with their specific
  ways of handling bodies (Pipes for Async, or Lwt_stream for Lwt).
* [lwt] Interface change: HTTP client calls now raise Lwt exceptions rather
  than return an option type.  This permits better error handling in Lwt.
* [lwt] Interface change: The `Server` callback now always provides a `body`
  argument, since `Cohttp_lwt_body` now explicitly supports empty bodys.
* Add `Cohttp.Header.is_keep_alive` to test if a connection should be reused.
* [lwt] Respect the `keep-alive` header in the server request handling.
* [async] Add a `Body` that takes a `Pipe` or a `string`, similarly to Lwt.
* Install `cohttp-server` binary even if tests are disabled.
* Begin an `examples` directory with some simple uses of the library.

* Use `Ipaddr.V6` to restore IPv6/AAAA RR support.
* `process_query` now takes an output buffer so it doesn't have to
  overwrite the input buffer it just parsed.
* Add Travis continuous integration scripts.
* Regenerate with OASIS 0.4.1
* Split the `dns.lwt` into a portable `dns.lwt-core` that doesn't
  require Unix (from which a Mirage version can be built).  The only
  change to existing applications is that Unix-specific functions
  have shifted into `Dns_resolver_unix` or `Dns_server_unix`, with
  the module types for `PROCESSOR` and `CLIENT` unchanged.
