!!! Using functional programming within an industrial product group: perspectives and perceptions
!!!! ACM ICFP, September 2010

This was a report delivered at ICFP 2010 about our experiences with using OCaml in the Xen management toolstack. Not directly Mirage-related, but much of the inspiration for trying out OCaml in a microkernel environment came out of this work. The [video](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1863557) is unfortunately only available behind the ACM paywall, but the paper can be found [here](/wiki/papers).
