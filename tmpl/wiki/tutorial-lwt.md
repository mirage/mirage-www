[Lwt](http://www.ocsigen.org/lwt) is a lightweight cooperative threading library for OCaml. A good way to understand Lwt and its use in Mirage is to write some simple code. This document introduces the basic concepts and suggests programs to write. Note that Lwt has a number of syntax extensions that are widely used in Mirage. These are introduced as you go along through the tutorial. Code for all examples is in the `mirage-skeleton/lwt/src` [repository](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/lwt/src).

##Tutorial

The full Lwt manual is available [elsewhere](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/manual/), but the minimal stuff needed to get started is here. The first useful function is the `return` statement, which constructs a constant thread:

```
  val return: 'a -> 'a Lwt.t
```

It is used to construct a thread that immediately returns with the provided value. Once the value is wrapped in an Lwt thread, it cannot directly be used (as the thread may not have completed yet). This is where `bind` comes in:

```
  val bind: 'a Lwt.t -> ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> 'b Lwt.t
```

`bind t f` creates a thread which waits for `t` to terminate, then passes the result to `f`. If `t` is a sleeping thread, then `bind t f` will be a sleeping thread too, until `t` terminates. If `t` fails, then the resulting thread will fail with the same exception.

There are two important operations to compose threads: `join` and `choose`.

```
  val join : unit Lwt.t list -> unit Lwt.t
```

`join` takes a list of threads and waits for all of them to terminate. If at least one thread fails then `join l` will fail with the same exception as the first to fail, after all threads terminate.

```
 val choose : 'a t list -> 'a t
```

`choose l` behaves as the first thread in l to terminate. If several threads are already terminated, one is chosen at random.

The infix operators `<&>` and `<?>` are defined in the Lwt module, where `a <&> b` is equivalent to `join [a; b]`, and `a <?> b` is equivalent to `choose [a; b]`.

## Sleep and join

### Challenge

Now write a program that spins off two threads, each of which sleep for some amount of time, say 1 and 2 seconds and then one prints "Heads", the other "Tails". After both have finished, it prints "Finished" and exits. To sleep for some time use `OS.Time.sleep` and to print to console use `OS.Console.log`. Note that `OS` is a Mirage-specific module, if you are using Lwt in another context, use `Lwt_unix.sleep` and `Lwt_io.write`.

You will need to have Mirage [installed](/wiki/install). Create a file `config.ml` with the following content:

```
  open Mirage

  let () =
    let main = foreign "Foo.Main" (console @-> job) in
    register "Foo.Main" [
      main $ default_console
    ]
```

Add `foo.ml` with the following content and edit it:

```
  open V1_LWT
  open Lwt
  open OS

  module Main (C : CONSOLE) = struct
    let start c =
      (* the guts go here *)
      return ()
  end
```


Assuming you are building for POSIX using native kernel sockets, compile the application by:

```
  mirage configure --unix
  mirage build
  mirage run   # Or ./main.native
```

If you are building for a different Mirage platform, change the `--unix` switches appropriately (presently either `--xen` or `--unix`).
The `OS` module packs several sub-modules depending of the backend, [unix](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/tree/master/unix/lib)
or [xen](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-platform/tree/master/xen/lib).

###Solution

```
  open V1_LWT (* provides the CONSOLE signature *)
  open Lwt    (* provides bind and join *)
  open OS     (* provides Env, Main, and Time *)

  module Main (C : CONSOLE) = struct
    let start c =
      bind (join [
        bind (Time.sleep 1.0) (fun () ->
          C.log c "Heads"; return ()
        );
        bind (Time.sleep 2.0) (fun () ->
          C.log c "Tails"; return ()
        );
      ]) (fun () ->
        C.log c "Finished"; return ()
      )
  end
```

This code is also found in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the `mirage-skeleton` code repository. Build it by setting the TARGET environment variable to `heads1` before running `mirage configure`.

###Syntax Extensions

Using Lwt does sometimes require significantly restructuring code, and in particular doesn't work with many of the more imperative OCaml control structures such as `for` and `while`. Luckily, Lwt includes a comprehensive [pa_lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt/api/Pa_lwt) syntax extension that makes writing threaded code as convenient as vanilla OCaml. Mirage includes this extension by default, so you can use it anywhere you want.

This is a good place to introduce some of these extensions. When opening the Lwt module, the infix operator `>>=` is made available. This operator is an alternative to the `bind` function and often makes the code more readable. E.g. consider `bind (bind (bind t f) g) h` and the operator based equivalent expression `t >>= f >>= g >>= h`. We can now rewrite the previous solution more simply:

```
  open V1_LWT (* provides the CONSOLE signature *)
  open Lwt    (* provides >>= and join *)
  open OS     (* provides Env, Main, and Time *)

  module Main (C : CONSOLE) = struct
    let start c =
      join [
        (Time.sleep 1.0 >>= fun () -> (C.log c "Heads"; return ()));
        (Time.sleep 2.0 >>= fun () -> (C.log c "Tails"; return ()));
       ] >>= fun () ->
         C.log c "Finished";
         return ()
  end
```

This is in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the repository. The target is `heads2`.


###Anonymous Bind

If you are chaining sequences of blocking I/O, a common pattern is to write:

```
  write stdio "Foo" >>= fun () ->
  write stdio "Bar" >>= fun () ->
  write stdio "Done"
```

You can replace these anonymous binds with the `>>` operator instead:

```
  write stdio "Foo" >>
  write stdio "Bar" >>
  write stdio "Done"
```

###Lwt Bindings

The binding operation reverses the normal `let` binding by specifying the name of the bound variable in the second argument. Consider the thread:

```
  e1 >>= fun x -> e2
```

Here, we wait for the result of `e1`, bind the result to `x` and continue into `e2`. You can replace this with the more natural `lwt` syntax to act as a "blocking let":

```
  lwt x = e1 in
  e2
```

Now, the code looks like just normal OCaml code, except that we substitute `lwt` for `let`, with the effect that the call blocks until the result of that thread is available. Lets revisit our heads and tails example from above and see how it looks when rewritten with these syntax extensions:

```
  open V1_LWT
  open Lwt
  open OS

  module Main (C : CONSOLE) = struct
    let start c =

      let heads =
        Time.sleep 1.0 >>
        return (C.log c "Heads");
      in
      let tails =
        Time.sleep 2.0 >>
        return (C.log c "Tails");
      in
      lwt () = heads <&> tails in
      C.log c "Finished";
      return ()
  end
```

This is in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the Mirage code repository. The target is `heads3`.

Here we define two threads, `heads` and `tails`, and block until they are both complete (via the `lwt ()` and the `<&>` join operator). If you want to print "Finished" before the previous threads are complete, just put the print statement (`Console.log`) before the join statement (`... <&> ...`).


##Cancelling

In order to cancel a thread, the function `cancel` (provided by the module Lwt) is needed. It has type `'a t -> unit` and does exactly what it says (except on certain complicated cases that are not in the scope of this tutorial). A simple timeout function that cancels a thread after a given number of seconds can be written easily:

```
  (* In this examples and all those afterwards, we consider Lwt and OS to be
     opened *)
  let timeout f t =
    Time.sleep f >>= fun () -> cancel t
```

###Challenge

This `timeout` function does not allow one to use the result returned by the thread `t`.

Modify the `timeout` function so that it returns either `None` if `t` has not yet returned after `f` seconds or `Some v` if `t` returns `v` within `f` seconds. In order to achieve this behaviour it is possible to use the function `state` that, given a thread, returns the state it is in, either `Sleep`, `Return` or `Fail`.

You can test your solution with this application, which creates a thread and that is cancelled before it returns:

```
  let t =  Time.sleep (Random.float 3.0) >> return "Heads" in
    timeout 2.0 t >>= fun v ->
    C.log c (match v with None -> "cancelled" | Some v -> v);
    C.log c "Finished";
    return ()
```

###Solution

```
  let timeout f t =
    Time.sleep f >>
    match state t with
    | Return v -> return (Some v)
    | _        -> cancel t; return None

```

This solution and application are found in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the repository. Build with target `timeout1`.

Does your solution match the one given here and always returns after `f` seconds, even when `t` returns within `f` seconds?

This is a good place to introduce a third operation to compose threads: `pick`.

```
  val pick : 'a t list -> 'a t
```

`pick` behaves exactly like `choose` except that it cancels all other sleeping threads when one terminates.


###Challenge

In a typical use of a timeout, if `t` returns before the timeout has expired, one would want the timeout to be cancelled right away. The next challenge is to modify the timeout function to return `Some v` right after `t` returns. Of course if the timeout does expire then it should cancel `t` and return `None`.

In order to test your solution, you can compile it to a mirage executable and run it using the skeleton provided for the first challenge.


###Solution

```
  let timeout f t =
    let tmout = Time.sleep f in
    pick [
      (tmout >>= fun () -> return None);
      (t >>= fun v -> return (Some v));
    ]
```

Found in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the repository. The target is `timeout2`.


##A Pipe example

###Challenge

Write an echo server, reading from a dummy input generator and, for each line it reads, writing it to the console. The server should never stop listening to the dummy input generator. Here is a basic dummy input generator:

```
  let read_line () =
    OS.Time.sleep (Random.float 2.5) >>
    Lwt.return (String.make (Random.int 20) 'a')
```

###Solution

```
  let rec echo_server () =
    lwt s = read_line () in
    Console.log c s;
    echo_server ()
```

This is in `lwt/src/unikernels.ml` in the repository. Build with the target `echo_server1`.

##Using Mailboxes

Among the different modules the Lwt library provides is `Lwt_mvar`. This module eases inter-thread communication. Any thread can place a value in a mailbox using the `put` function; dually, the `take` function removes a value from a mailbox and returns it. `take`'s type, `'a Lwt_mvar.t -> 'a Lwt.t`, indicates that a call to the function may block (and let other threads run). The function actually returns only when a value is available in the mailbox.

Here are the needed functions from the `Lwt_mvar` module:

```
  (* type of a mailbox variable *)
  type 'a t

  (* creates a new empty mailbox variable *)
  val create_empty : unit -> 'a t

  (* puts a value into a mailbox variable, and blocks if it is full *)
  val put : 'a t -> 'a -> unit Lwt.t

  (* will take any available value and block if the mailbox is empty *)
  val take : 'a t -> 'a Lwt.t
```

###Challenge

Write a small set of functions to help do pipeline parallelism. The interface to be implemented is the following (names should give away the appropriate semantic):

```
  val map: ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt_mvar.t -> 'b Lwt_mvar.t
  val split : ('a * 'b) Lwt_mvar.t -> 'a Lwt_mvar.t * 'b Lwt_mvar.t
  val filter: ('a -> bool Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt_mvar.t -> 'a Lwt_mvar.t
```

### Solution

```
let map f m_in =
  let m_out = Lwt_mvar.create_empty () in
  let rec aux () =
    Lwt_mvar.(
      take m_in   >>=
      f           >>= fun v ->
      put m_out v >>
      aux ()
    )
  in
  let t = aux () in
  m_out

let split m_ab =
  let m_a, m_b = Lwt_mvar.(create_empty (), create_empty ()) in
  let rec aux () =
    Lwt_mvar.take m_ab >>= fun (a, b) ->
    join [
      Lwt_mvar.put m_a a;
      Lwt_mvar.put m_b b;
    ] >> aux ()
  in
  let t = aux () in
  (m_a, m_b)

let filter f m_a =
  let m_out = Lwt_mvar.create_empty () in
  let rec aux () =
    Lwt_mvar.take m_a >>= fun a ->
    f a >>= function
      | true -> Lwt_mvar.put m_out a >> aux ()
      | false -> aux ()
  in
  let t = aux () in
  m_out
```

This code can also be found in `lwt/src/mvar_unikernels.ml` in the `mirage-skeleton` repository.

Note that in each of the above a recursive Lwt thread is created and will run forever. However, if the pipeline ever needs to be torn down then this recursive thread should be cancelled. This can be done by modifying the above functions to also return the `'t Lwt.t` returned by `aux` in each case, which can then be cancelled when required.

### Challenge

Using the pipelining helpers, change the echo server into a string processing server. The new version should output each line of text uppercased (`String.uppercase` can help) after waiting for `l` seconds where `l` is the length of the string.

### Solution

```
  let read_line () =
    Lwt.return (String.make (Random.int 20) 'a')

  let wait_strlen str =
    OS.Time.sleep (float_of_int (String.length str)) >>
    Lwt.return str

  let cap_str str =
    Lwt.return (String.uppercase str)

  let ( |> ) x f = f x

  let echo_server c () =
    let m_input = Lwt_mvar.create_empty () in
    let m_output = m_input |> map wait_strlen |> map cap_str in

    let rec read () =
      read_line ()           >>= fun s ->
      Lwt_mvar.put m_input s >>=
      read
    in
    let rec write () =
      Lwt_mvar.take m_output >>= fun r ->
      Console.log c r;
      write ()
    in
    (read ()) <&> (write ())
}
```
This code can be found in `lwt/src/mvar_unikernels.ml` in the repository. Build with target `echo_server2`.

###Challenge

To exercise all the pipelining helpers, set up an integer processing server with the following stages:

Every second write a tuple containing a pair of small random integers `(Random.int 1000, Random.int 1000)` into a mailbox. Process it through a stage that produces a tuple containing the sum and the product of the input integers, `split` the tuple into two mvars and for each of the mvars insert a stage that simply prints the value and then puts it to an output mvar. Next insert a filter stage that only lets odd numbers through. Finally add a stage that prints the word "Odd" if anything reaches it.


###Solution

```
  let add_mult (a, b) =
    return (a + b, a * b)

  let print_and_go c str a =
    Console.log c (Printf.sprintf "%s %d" str a);
    return a

  let test_odd a =
    return (1 = (a mod 2))

  let rec print_odd c m =
    lwt a = Lwt_mvar.take m in
    Console.log c (Printf.sprintf "Odd: %d" a);
    print_odd c m

  let ( |> ) x f = f x

  let int_server c () =
    let m_input = Lwt_mvar.create_empty () in
    let (ma, mm) = m_input |> map add_mult |> split in
    let _ = ma |> map (print_and_go c "Add:") |> filter test_odd |> print_odd c in
    let _ = mm |> map (print_and_go c "Mult:") |> filter test_odd |> print_odd c in
    let rec inp () =
      Lwt_mvar.put m_input (Random.int 1000, Random.int 1000) >>
      Time.sleep 1. >>
      inp () in
    inp ()
```

This is in `lwt/src/mvar_unikernels.ml` in the Mirage code repository. Build with target `int_server`.


##Stream Processing

The pipelining challenges of the previous section uses mailboxes provided by the `Lwt_mvar` module. One of the feature of such values is that no more than one message can be deposited in the mailbox. This is made obvious by the return type of `Lwt_mvar.put` being in `Lwt.t`. This provides a natural throttle mechanism to our pipeline. However, in specific cases, such a throttle is superfluous.

Using the `Lwt_stream` module, one can devise a different pipeline with a greedier processing scheme. Several functions can be used to create a stream, all of them can be defined via:

```
  val create : unit -> 'a t * ('a option -> unit)
```

The `create` function returns a stream and a push function. The push function is the only available way to add content to the stream. Pushing `None` will close the stream, while pushing `Some x` will make `x` available in the stream.

There are several ways to read from a stream. The most direct one being

```
  val get : 'a t -> 'a option Lwt.t
```

`get s` returns either `Some x` when `x` is available (which may be right away) or `None` when stream is closed. Order of elements in streams is preserved, meaning that elements are pulled in the order they are pushed.

###Challenge

Write the same pipelining library as in the mailbox challenge, replacing instances of `Lwt_mvar.t` by `Lwt_stream.t`:

```
  val map: ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt_stream.t -> 'b Lwt_stream.t
  val split : ('a * 'b) Lwt_stream.t -> 'a Lwt_stream.t * 'b Lwt_stream.t
  val filter: ('a -> bool Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt_stream.t -> 'a Lwt_stream.t
```

###Solution

```
  let map f ins =
    let (outs, push) = Lwt_stream.create () in
    let rec aux () = match_lwt Lwt_stream.get ins with
      | None -> push None; return ()
      | Some x -> lwt y = f x in push (Some y); aux ()
    in
    let _ = aux () in
    outs

  let split iab =
    let (oa, pa) = Lwt_stream.create () in
    let (ob, pb) = Lwt_stream.create () in
    let rec aux () = match_lwt Lwt_stream.get source with
      | None -> pa None; pb None; return ()
      | Some (a,b) -> pa (Some a); pb (Some b); aux ()
    in
    let _ = aux () in
    (oa, ob)

  let filter p ins =
    let (outs, push) = Lwt_stream.create () in
    let rec aux () = match_lwt Lwt_stream.get ins with
      | None -> push None; return ()
      | Some x -> match_lwt p x with
        | true -> push (Some x); aux ()
        | false -> aux ()
    in
    let _ = aux () in
    outs
```

This is in `lwt/src/stream_server.ml` in the repository. Build with target `stream_server`.

Notice, in the provided solution, the usage of `f` in `map`: only when `f` returns is the next element polled and treated. (The same remark applies to the predicate function `p` in `filter`.) This means that the elements of the stream are processed serially.

The `Lwt_stream` library actually provides a number of processing functions. Some functions are suffixed with `_s` meaning that they operate sequentially over the elements, other with `_p` meaning that they operate in parallel over the elements. The module `Lwt_list` uses the same suffixing policy.


##Mutexes and cooperation

With Lwt, it is often possible to avoid mutexes altogether! The web server from the [Ocsigen](http://ocsigen.org) project uses only two, and the Mirage source code none. In usual concurrent systems, mutexes are used to prevent two (or more) threads executing concurrently on a given piece of data. This can happen when a thread is preemptively interrupted and another one starts running. In Lwt, a thread executes serially until it explicitly yields (most commonly via `bind`); for this reason, Lwt threads are said to be [cooperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking#Cooperative_multitasking.2Ftime-sharing).

From the coder's perspective, it means that the evaluation of expressions without the `Lwt.t` type will *never* go through the thread scheduler. Note however, that it is possible to switch threads without executing the scheduler via the `wakeup` function. As a result, instead of surrounding an expression with `lock` and `unlock` statements, one can simply enforce that the type of the expression is not `Lwt.t` and check for the absence of calls to `wakeup`. Finally, be aware that some functions from the Lwt standard libraries do use thread switching.

The obvious danger associated with cooperative threading is having threads not cooperating: if an expression takes a lot of time to compute with no cooperation point, then the whole program hangs. The `Lwt.yield` function introduces an explicit cooperation point. `sleep`ing also obviously makes the thread cooperate.

If locking a data structure is still needed between yield points, the `Lwt_mutex` module provides the necessary functions. To obtain more information on thread switching (and how to prevent it) read the Lwt mailing list archive: [Lwt_stream, thread switch within push function](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/ocsigen/2011-09/msg00029.html) which continues [here](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/ocsigen/2011-10/msg00001.html).

##Exceptions and Try/Catch

One very, very important thing to remember with cooperative threading is that raising exceptions is not safe to do between yield points. In general, you should never call `raise` directly. Lwt provides an alternative syntax:

```
  open V1_LWT
  open Lwt
  open OS

  exception Foo

  module Main (C : CONSOLE) = struct
    let start c =
      try_lwt
        let x = ... in
        raise_lwt Foo
      with
        |Foo -> return (Console.log c "Foo raised")
  end
```

This looks similar to normal OCaml code, except that the caught exception has an `Lwt.t` return type appended to it.

##Control Flow

Lwt also provides equivalents of `for` and `while` that block on each iteration, saving you the trouble of rewriting the code to use `bind` recursively. Just use `for_lwt` and `while_lwt` instead; for example:

```
  for_lwt i = 0 to 10 do
    OS.Time.sleep (float_of_int i) >>
    return (OS.Console.log c "foo")
  done
```

There is also a `match_lwt` which will bind the result of a thread and immediately pattern-match on its value. Thus, the two fragments of code are equivalent:

```
  let e1 >>= function
  |true -> ...
  |false -> ...
```

```
  match_lwt e1 with
  |true -> ...
  |false -> ...
```

##How does it work

Understanding the basic principles behind Lwt can be helpful.

The core of Lwt is based on an event loop. In "standard" (non-Mirage) settings,
this loop is started using the `Lwt_main.run` function. However, when using
Mirage, the loop is automatically started by the `main.ml` file autogenerated
by the `mirage` command-line tool..

Because it's based on an event loop, threads are actually very cheap in Lwt
when compared to preemptive system threads. Sleeping actually registers an
event that will wake up the associated thread when possible. Depending on the
backend, the event registering slightly differs.
