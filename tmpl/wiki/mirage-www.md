This assumes that you've followed the [Hello World](/wiki/hello-world)
instructions from earlier and are now familiar with the basic console, block
device and networking configurations from the
[mirage-skeleton](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton) repository.  To
build the live Mirage website, we'll need several device drivers: two block
devices for the static HTML content and the templates, and a network device to
actually serve the traffic.

First, clone the website [source code](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www):

```
git clone git://github.com/mirage/mirage-www
cd mirage-www/src
less config.ml
```

This `config.ml` is more complex to reflect all the different ways we want
to statically build the webite, but it also does a lot more!  We'll walk through it step by step.

## Building a Unix version

The `src/config.ml` takes its configuration variables from some environment variables,
which can be supplied manually or provided via the `Makefile`:

```
MIRAGE ?= mirage
MODE ?= unix
FS ?= fat
NET ?= direct
DHCP ?= 

```

These `Makefile` variables do the following:

* `MIRAGE` set the location of the `mirage` binary (normally you 
  don't need to override this).
* `MODE` is either `unix` or `xen` depending on what backend you're compiling for.
* `FS` is either `fat` or `crunch`, depending on if you want to use an external block device or simply compile the website contents directly into the `mirage` binary.
* `DHCP` is either blank or set to any value (which is considered `true`). Disabling DHCP assumes a development IP address of `10.0.0.2`, although this can be overridden by editing the `config.ml` (see the [live website configuration](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/blob/master/.travis-www.ml) for an example of a static IPv4 address).

### A Unix development workflow

For editing content and working with the website on a day-to-day basis, we can
just compile it to run using kernel sockets and a pass-through filesystem.  This
is pretty similar a conventional web server, and means you can edit content
using your favourite editor.

```
$ cd src
$ env NET=socket FS=crunch mirage configure --unix
$ make depend
$ make
$ make run
```

Alternatively you can use the toplevel `Makefile` to do this directly:

```
$ make NET=socket FS=crunch
$ make run
```

For the rest of the tutorial, we'll call `mirage` directly rather than use the
`Makefile`, as this makes the tools usage clearer.  If you run the above
commands, the website will now be available on `http://localhost/`.

## Building the direct networking version

Now you can build the Unix unikernel using the direct stack, following much the same procedure
as the hello world examples.

```
$ cd src
$ env NET=direct mirage configure --unix
$ make depend
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-www
```

This will open a [tap device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP) device and
assign itself a default IP of `10.0.0.2/255.255.255.0`.  You need to set up your
routing so that you can see this IP by assigning an IP to the `tap0` interface.

```
$ sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
$ ping 10.0.0.2
```

If you see ping responses, then you are now communicating with the Mirage
unikernel via the OCaml TCP/IP stack!  Point your web browser at `http://10.0.0.2`
and you should be able to surf this website too.

### Serving the site from a FAT filesystem instead

This site won't quite compile to Xen yet.  Despite doing all networking via an
OCaml TCP/IP stack, we still have a dependency on the Unix filesystem for our
files.  Mirage provides a [FAT filesystem](http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-fat)
which we'll use as an alternative.  Our new `config.ml` will now contain this:

The FAT filesystem needs to be installed onto a block device, which we assign
to a Unix file.  The driver for this is provided via *mmap* in the
[mirage/mirage-block-unix](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-unix) module.

Now build the FAT version of the website.  The `config.ml` supplied in the real
mirage-www repository uses an environment variable to switch to these
variables, so we can quickly try it as follows.

```
$ cd src
$ env FS=fat mirage configure --unix
$ make depend
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-www
$ sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
```

The `make-fat-images.sh` script uses the `fat` command-line helper installed
by the `ocaml-fat` package to build the FAT block image for you.
If you now access the website, it is serving the traffic straight from the
FAT image you just created, without requiring a Unix filesystem at all!

You can inspect the resulting FAT images for yourself by using the `fat`
command line tool, and the `make-fat1-image.sh` script.

```
$ file fat1.img 
fat1.img: x86 boot sector, code offset 0x0, OEM-ID "ocamlfat",
sectors/cluster 4, FAT  1, root entries 512, Media descriptor 0xf8,
sectors/FAT 2, sectors 1728 (volumes > 32 MB) , dos < 4.0 BootSector (0x0)

$ fat list fat1.img 
/wiki (DIR)(1856 bytes)
/wiki/xen-synthesize-virtual-disk.md (FILE)(8082 bytes)
/wiki/xen-suspend.md (FILE)(14120 bytes)
/wiki/xen-events.md (FILE)(10921 bytes)
/wiki/xen-boot.md (FILE)(5244 bytes)
/wiki/weekly (DIR)(768 bytes)
```

## Building a Xen kernel

We're now ready to build a Xen kernel.  This can use eithr FAT or a builtin
crunch (to avoid the need for an external block device).  The latter is the
default, for simplicity's sake.

```
$ cd src
$ mirage configure --xen
$ make depend
$ make
$ make run
```

This will build a static kernel that uses the `ocaml-crunch` tool to convert
the static website files into an OCaml module that is linked directly into
the image.  While it of course will not work for very large websites, it's
just fine for this website (or for configuration files that will never be
very large).  The advantage of this mode is that you don't need to worry
about configuring any external block devices for your VM, and boot times are
much faster as a result.

You can now boot the `mir-www.xen` kernel using `xl` (don't forget to supply
it a VIF so that the network can work).

### Modifying networking to use DHCP or static IP

Chances are that the Xen kernel you just built doesn't have a useful IP
address, since it was hardcoded to `10.0.0.2`.  You can modify the HTTP driver
to give it a static IP address, as the [live deployment script](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/blob/master/.travis-www.ml) does.

We've shown you the very low-levels of the configuration system in Mirage here.
While it's not instantly user-friendly, it's an extremely powerful way of
assembling your own components for your unikernel for whatever specialised
unikernels you want to build.

We'll talk about the deployment scripts that run the [live
site](http://openmirage.org) in the [next article](/docs/deploying-via-ci).
