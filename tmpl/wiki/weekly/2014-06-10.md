### Notes ###

#### Xen Hackathon ####

The [Xen Developer Hackathon][xen-hack] took place a couple of weeks ago and
Anil, ThomasL, Dave, Jon and Nik all attended.  Apparently it did turn into
a chatathon as [previously predicted][prev-notes].

A group of people went through Amir's [Jekyll to Unikernel post][ac-post] to
get their sites building using TravisCI. They did get this working but the
post was written based on a Mac workflow and some parts didn't work well on
other machines, specifically involving tap interfaces (e.g. `sudo mirage run`
didn't work as expected). In general, Amir mentioned that the blog post
isn't going to get updated but it should point to somewhere that current
information is available for people to follow (that can account for any
quirks on different systems). The Mirage website would be good but updating
this isn't as easy as a wiki. 

Other than the above, there were lots of conversations with others people
including those trying lots guests on Xen and seeing lots of latency.
Important for us as we want to be able to run lots of unikernels on top of a
single Xen instance.

#### Irmin ####

[Irmin][irmin-repo] 0.8.1 was [released][irmin-release]. ThomasG has been
working on an filesystem backend implementation. You can take a normal
filesystem and write at the block level. Next step is to expose Irmin as a
filesystem. So you can use the filesystem and connect somewhere else to get
the history back.  Practically speaking, you build an Irmin filesystem on
top of an existing filesystem (e.g FAT). It'll be a combinator that takes
the FAT implementation and make a new one that's used/exposed (so the file
system is like staging). *\[If these notes are confusing, it's because I
couldn't keep up - AC :)\]*

ThomasG also learned that the DOS protocol doesn't let you have two letter
directories. Also had some discussion on FAT, blockstore and key value
stores.

#### Conduit ####

The network stack has become a chimney, where the underlying choices are
affecting things further up the stack. Anil has been thinking about
different approaches and discussing things with people. One thought was
around using functors but that leads to having a functorised stack and then the
applications also have to deal with things this way and whole universe becomes
functorised. This becomes difficult to use.  Another approach is to use
objects (or at least partially) and this seems like it would work much
better. In any case, this is blocking other people's cohttp fixes but looks
like there is a workable solution to this. Anil will have to write this
down to clarify it and the details are quite involved (but are to do with
existential types -- in case anyone feels like diving into it). 

In general conduit will permit people to use either openSSL bindings or the
new [TLS library][TLS] and doesn't impose those choices on anyone.

#### Network fuzz testing ####

Mindy is in a cycle of finding bugs and fixing them. Been thinking about
the platform question and doing research today. Also saw
[Balraj's email][balraj], who has been bisecting to figure out where/when
the problems arose in the stack. It turns out that it's a set of commits
over Christmas/New Year by Anil.

Overall, it's a great sign that we're able to go back and pin down which set
of commits introduced the problems but it does show that we need to improve
the type safety in the stack and add unit tests. Any thoughts on unit test
frameworks for networking protocols would be useful so please do send them to
the [mailing list][list].

#### Unikernel deployment ####


We currently have two machines, configured with Xen that we could deploy our
unikernels to. Amir would like to put his unikernels there and (when stable)
start moving more of the static sites we have to those machines. It should
be possible to get an account for Anil and at the moment users would need to
write their own config file. There is the question of DNS servers.  

In the long term the idea is that we each have our own unikernel DNS servers
but in the short term to have a separate DNS server that would know about
the mapping between the names and the IP addresses. We have a set of IP
addresses on a wiki and can grab one of those and run with it. For example
Mort has one but has not deployed yet as he's blocked on filesystem issues.
Essentially, his site is large enough (papers, media, etc) that he needs two
FAT images, which isn't handled very well.  Can achieve it locally but it
requires tweaking by hand and shell scripts, so not really appropriate for
deployment. Is thinking of patching the Mirage tool but has not time to get
to that. Should create an issue to track this as others are likely to follow
in his wake as their sites grow (e.g Amir switched from Crunch to FAT some
time ago). An issue might help surface others who are having similar kinds
of problems.


#### Call schedule and organisation ####

Amir points out that we should improve the call organisation. Announcement
of the call was sent about an hour beforehand and we should be giving others
more time. Proposed that a notice is sent on the Monday beforehand to the
list to collect [Agenda items][agenda], and then the call is confirmed the
following day.  Regular people on the call can help by adding their agenda
items in advance and Amir will structure them and help keep the call focused
(which it usually is anyway).


#### AoB ####

Mindy and ThomasL have written some **awesome blog posts** recently. The
posts made it to the front pages of news aggregators and generated a lot of
interesting discussion. The posts were
[Python to OCaml: Retrospective][ocaml-summary] ([HN][hn1], [Reddit][r1])
and [The Minnesota Goodbye][mindy] ([HN][hn2]).

**OCaml-TLS** is is gearing up to an alpha release and we will point people
to the Mirage mailing list for communications.

Some **discussion about Mirage 2.0** release and what the requirements would
be for it. Would need ARM support, Irmin and a story on distributed
computing. This all seems achievable but really would like to have this by
the time of [OSCON][].

**Carmack** thinks we're "really interesting". Cue lots of fist pumping.

Next call will be **24th June**. Amir will send an email to the list for
[Agenda items][agenda] on the 23rd.
