First make sure you have followed the [installation instructions](/wiki/install)
to get a working MirageOS installation. The examples below are in the
[mirage-skeleton](http://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton) repository. Begin by
cloning and changing directory to it:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton.git
$ cd mirage-skeleton
```

### Step 1: Hello World!

As a first step, let's build and run the MirageOS "Hello World" unikernel -- this
will print `hello\nworld\n` 4 times before terminating:

```
hello
world
hello
world
hello
world
hello
world
```

First, let's look at the code:

```
$ cat console/unikernel.ml
open Lwt.Infix

module Main (C: V1_LWT.CONSOLE) = struct

  let start c =
    let rec loop = function
      | 0 -> Lwt.return_unit
      | n ->
        C.log_s c "hello" >>= fun () ->
        OS.Time.sleep 1.0 >>= fun () ->
        C.log_s c "world" >>= fun () ->
        loop (n-1)
    in
    loop 4

end
```

**Note**: If you aren't familiar with the Lwt library (and the `>>=` operator it provides),
you may want to read at least the start of the [Lwt tutorial](tutorial-lwt) first.

To veteran OCaml programmers among you, this might look a little odd: we have a
`Main` module parameterised by another module (`C`, of type `CONSOLE`) that
contains a method `start` taking a single parameter `c` (an instance of a
`CONSOLE`). This is the basic structure required to make this a MirageOS
unikernel rather than a standard OCaml POSIX application.

The concrete implementation of `CONSOLE` will be supplied at compile-time,
depending on the target that you are compiling for. This configuration is stored
in `config.ml`, which is very simple for our first application.

```
$ cat console/config.ml
open Mirage

let main =
  foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-> job)

let () =
  register "console" [main $ default_console]
```

The configuration file is a normal OCaml module that calls `register` to create
one or more jobs, each of which represent a process (with a start/stop
lifecycle). Each job most likely depends on some device drivers; all the
available device drivers are defined in the `Mirage` module (see
[here](http://mirage.github.io/mirage/)).

In this case, the `main` variable declares that the entry point of the process
is the `Main` module from the file `unikernel.ml`. The `@->` combinator is used
to add a device driver to the list of functor arguments in the job definition
(see `unikernel.ml`), and the final value of using this combinator should always
be a `job` if you intend to register it.

Notice that we refer to the module name as a string here, instead of directly as
an OCaml value. The `mirage` command-line tool evaluates this configuration file
at build-time and outputs a `main.ml` that has the concrete values filled in for
you, with the exact modules varying by which backend you selected (e.g. Unix or
Xen).

MirageOS mirrors the Xen model on UNIX as far as possible: your application is
built as a unikernel which needs to be instantiated and run whether on UNIX or
on Xen. When your unikernel is run, it starts much as a VM on Xen does -- and so
must be passed references to devices such as the console, network interfaces and
block devices on startup.

In this case, this simple `hello world` example requires just a console for
output, so we register a single `Job` consisting of the `Hello.Main` module
(and, implicitly its `start` function) and passing it a single reference to a
console.

You can find the module signatures of all the device drivers (such as `CONSOLE`)
in the [`types/`](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/tree/master/types) directory
of the main MirageOS repository. Since you'll find yourself referring back to
these quite often when building MirageOS applications, it's worth bookmarking
the [documentation](http://mirage.github.io) for this module.

#### Building a Unix binary

We invoke all this by configuring, building and finally running the resulting
unikernel under Unix first.

```
$ cd console
$ mirage configure -t unix
```

`mirage configure` generates a `Makefile` with all the build rules included from
evaluating the configuration file, and a `main.ml` that represents the entry
point of your unikernel. The `configure` step should ensure all external OPAM
dependencies are installed, but in case not, execute `make depend` to check and
install if any are missing.

```
$ make
```

This builds a UNIX binary called `mir-console` that contains the simple console
application.  If you are on a multicore machine and want to do parallel builds,
`export OPAMJOBS=4` (or some other value equal to the number of cores) will do
the trick.

Finally to run your application, as it is a standard Unix binary, simply run it
directly and observe the exciting console commands that our `for` loop is
generating:

```
$ ./mir-console
```

<br />
<div class="panel callout">
  <i class="fa fa-info fa-3x pull-left"> </i>
  <p>
    Note that when you execute <code>mirage configure -t xen</code>, the target
    unikernel's <code>target.xl</code> and other auto-generated configuration
    files are regenerated, overwriting any modifications you may have made. If
    you edit any of these, we suggest renaming and/or committing them to source
    control to avoid it being overwritten subsequently.
  </p>
</div>

#### Building a Xen unikernel

If you are on a 64-bit Linux system able to build Xen images, simply change
`-t unix` for `-t xen` to build a Xen VM:

```
$ mirage configure -t xen
$ make
```

*Everything* else remains the same! The `main.ml` and `Makefile` generated
differ significantly, but since the source code of your application was
parameterised over the `CONSOLE` type, it doesn't matter-- you do not need to
make any changes for your code to run when linked against the Xen console driver
instead of Unix.

When you build the Xen version, you'll have a `mir-console.xen` unikernel that
can be booted as a standalone kernel. You will also see two generated files
named `console.xl` and `console.xl.in` in the current directory. The
`console.xl` file is a Xen configuration file with sensible defaults for
the VM configuration options, intended for quickly trying the unikernel on
the build machine. The file `console.xl.in` has all the configuration options
necessary for the VM to boot but has all the references to resources on the
deployment host replaced by substitutable variables. The `console.xl.in` is
intended for production use; while `console.xl` is intended for development
and test.

The `console.xl` will look something like this:


```
# Generated by Mirage (Tue, 14 Jul 2015 11:17:40 GMT).

name = 'console'
kernel = '/home/vagrant/mirage-skeleton/console/mir-console.xen'
builder = 'linux'
memory = 256
on_crash = 'preserve'

disk = [  ]

# if your system uses openvswitch then either edit /etc/xen/xl.conf and set
#     vif.default.script="vif-openvswitch"
# or add "script=vif-openvswitch," before the "bridge=" below:
vif = [ 'bridge=xenbr0' ]
```

`xl` replaced `xm` as the default in Xen 4.2, with `xm` being removed completely
in Xen 4.5. If you find that you're running the `xend` daemon, then you should
use the `xm` command. Edit this to customise the VM name, memory or the network
bridge and then run it:

```
$ sudo xl create -c console.xl
Parsing config from console.xl
MirageOS booting....
Initialising timer interface
Initialising console ... done.
hello
world
hello
world
hello
world
hello
world
$
```

As you can see, after some initial boot messages have been displayed as Xen
boots the VM, you see the same output on the Xen console as you did on the UNIX
version you ran earlier. If you need more help, or would like to see how to boot
your Xen VM on Amazon's EC2, [click here](/wiki/xen-boot). Finally if you are
using an ARM processor, such as the CubieBoard, you should follow extra
ARM-specific documentation found
[here](http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-xen-minios-arm).


### Step 2: Getting a block device

Most useful unikernels will need to obtain data from the outside world, so we'll
explain this subsystem next.

#### Sector-addressible block devices

The [block/](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/block)
directory in `mirage-skeleton` contains an example of attaching a raw block
device to your unikernel. The
[V1.BLOCK](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/blob/1.1.0/types/V1.mli#L134)
interface signature contains the operations that are possible on a block device:
primarily reading and writing aligned buffers to a 64-bit offset within the
device.

On Unix, the development workflow to handle block devices is by mapping them
onto local files. The `config.ml` for the block example looks like this:

```
open Mirage

let main = foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-> block @-> job)

let img =
  if_impl Key.is_xen
    (block_of_file "xvda1")
    (block_of_file "disk.img")

let () =
  register "block_test" [main $ default_console $ img]
```

The `main` binding looks much like the earlier console example, except for the
addition of a `block` device in the list. When we register the job, we supply a
block device from a local file via `block_of_file`.

<br />
<div class="panel callout">
  <i class="fa fa-info fa-3x pull-left"> </i>
  <p>
    As an aside, if you have your editor configured with OCaml mode, you should
    be able to see the inferred types for some of the variables in the
    configuration file. The <code>@-></code> and <code>$</code> combinators are
    designed such that any mismatches in the declared device driver types and
    the concrete registered implementations will result in a type error at
    configuration time.
  </p>
</div>

Build this on Unix in the same way as the console example.

```
$ cd block
$ mirage configure -t unix
$ make
$ ./generate_disk_img.sh
$ ./mir-block_test
```

The `generate_disk_img.sh` script just calls `dd` to create an empty file that
will act as our block device. Once it runs, `mir-block-test` will write a series
of patterns to the block device and read them back to check that they are the
same (the logic for this is in `unikernel.ml` within the `Block_test` module).

The Xen version works the same way. First build the code:

```
$ mirage configure -t xen
$ make
$ ./generate_disk_img.sh # only required if not executed as above
```

This will output a Xen config file called `block_test.xl`. It will look
approximately like this (note the additional `disk` definition that was
generated automatically by Mirage):

```
# Generated by Mirage (Mon, 20 Jul 2015 12:23:24 GMT).

name = 'block_test'
kernel = '/Users/djs/djs55/mirage-skeleton/block/mir-block_test.xen'
builder = 'linux'
memory = 256
on_crash = 'preserve'

disk = [ 'format=raw, vdev=xvdb, access=rw, target=/Users/djs/djs55/mirage-skeleton/block/disk.img' ]
```

Now you just need to boot the VM as before, and you should see the same output
(after the VM boot preamble) -- but now MirageOS is linked against the Xen
[block device driver](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen) and is mapping
the unikernel's block requests directly through to it, rather than relying on
the host OS (the Linux or FreeBSD kernel):

```

$
```

On ARM, when `qemu` is not available, it is better to do it through `losetup` so
that you can access the 'disk':

```
$ sudo losetup -f ../block/disk.img
$ sudo losetup -a
```

Then edit the `block_test.xl` configuration so that the `disk` line reads as
follows:

```
disk = [ 'format=raw, vdev=xvdb, access=rw, target=/dev/loop0' ]
```

### Step 3: Key/value stores

The earlier block device example shows how very low-level access can work. Now
let's move up to a more familiar abstraction: a key/value store that can
retrieve buffers from string keys. This is essential for many common uses such
as retrieving configuration data or website HTML and images.

The
[kv_ro_crunch/](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/kv_ro_crunch)
directory in `mirage-skeleton` contains the simplest key/value store example.
The subdirectory `t/` contains a couple of data files that the unikernel uses.
Our example `unikernel.ml` reads in the data from one file and compares to the
other file, printing out `YES` if the values match, and `NO` otherwise.

The `config.ml` should look familiar after the earlier block and console
examples:

```
open Mirage

let main =
  foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-> kv_ro @-> kv_ro @-> job)

let disk1 = crunch "t"
let disk2 = crunch "t"

let () =
  register "kv_ro" [main $ default_console $ disk1 $ disk2]
```

We construct the `kv_ro` devices (`disk1` and `disk2`) by using the `crunch`
function. This takes a single directory as its argument, and converts that
entire directory into a static ML file that can respond with the file contents
directly. This removes the need to have an external block device entirely and is
very convenient indeed for small files.

Build the example and run it in the usual way under either Unix or Xen. Because
this no longer needs an external block device, you can run it under Xen without
having to edit the `xl` configuration file at all. You can read the generated ML
file by looking at the `static1.ml` file in your build tree.

Unix:

```
$ cd kv_ro_crunch
$ mirage configure -t unix
$ make
$ less static1.ml # the generated filesystem
$ ./mir-kv_ro
```

Xen:

```
$ mirage configure -t xen
$ make
$ sudo xl create -c kv_ro.xl
Parsing config from kv_ro.xl
MirageOS booting....
Initialising timer interface
Initialising console ... done.
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
YES!
```

Of course, this scheme doesn't really scale up to large websites, and we often
need a more elaborate configuration for larger datasets depending on how we are
deploying our unikernels (i.e. for development or production). Switch to the
[kv_ro/](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/kv_ro) directory,
which has exactly the same example as before, but with several new configuration
options: it can generate a block device that contains a FAT filesystem that
mirror the directory contents, or (when running under Unix) simply proxy calls
dynamically to the underlying filesystem.

Since the `config.ml` file is normal OCaml that is executed at build time, all
of this selection logic is simple enough.

```
open Mirage

let disk = generic_kv_ro "t"

let main =
  foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-> kv_ro @-> kv_ro @-> job)

let () =
  register "kv_ro" [main $ default_console $ disk $ disk]
```

This example is controlled by setting the `FS` environment variable at build
time. If you set it to `fat`, then the configuration tool will generate the
appropriate settings for external filesystem access.

On OSX:

```
$ mirage configure -t unix --kv_ro fat
$ ./make-fat1-image.sh
$ file fat1.img
fat1.img: x86 boot sector, code offset 0x0, OEM-ID "ocamlfat",
sectors/cluster 4, FAT  1, root entries 512, Media descriptor 0xf8,
sectors/FAT 1, sectors 49 (volumes > 32 MB) , dos < 4.0 BootSector (0x0)
```

or, on Linux:

```
$ mirage configure -t unix --kv_ro fat
$ ./make-fat1-image.sh
$ file fat1.img
fat1.img: x86 boot sector
```

However, notice that the definition of `disk` now checks to see if the build is
happening on Unix or Xen when crunch mode is requested. If the build is Xen,
then a statically linked filesystem is used. On Unix however, the overhead of
building this can be removed by simply passing through to the underlying
filesystem, which is done via the `direct_kv_ro` implementation.

You should now be seeing the power of the MirageOS configuration tool: we have
built several applications that use fairly complex concepts such as filesystems
and block devices that are independent of the implementations (by virtue of our
application logic being a functor), and then are able to assemble several
combinations of unikernels via relatively simple configuration files.

### Step 4: Networking

Block devices don't require a huge amount of configuration, but now we move onto
networking, which has far more knobs attached. There are several ways that we
might want to configure our networking:

* On Unix, it's convenient to use the standard kernel socket API for developing
  higher level protocols (such as
  [HTTP](http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp)). These run over TCP or UDP and
  so sockets work just fine.
* When we want finer control over the network stack, or simply to test the OCaml
  networking subsystem, we can use a userspace device facility such as the
  common Unix [tuntap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP) to parse Ethernet
  frames from userspace. This requires additional configuration to assign IP
  addresses, and possibly configure a network bridge to let the unikernel talk
  to the outside world.
* Once the unikernel works under Unix with the direct
  [OCaml TCP/IP stack](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip), recompiling it
  under Xen is just a matter of linking in the
  [Xen netfront](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen) driver to provide the
  Ethernet frames directly to the unikernel.

All of this can be manipulated via the `config.ml` file through standard OCaml
code as before; we use the `NET` environment variable in the example below. The
example below is config.ml from the
[stackv4/](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/tree/master/stackv4)
directory in `mirage-skeleton`.

```
open Mirage

let handler = foreign "Unikernel.Main" (console @-> stackv4 @-> job)

let stack = generic_stackv4 default_console tap0

let () =
  register "stackv4" [handler $ default_console $ stack]
```

This configuration shows how composable the network stack subsystem is: the
application can be configured at compile-time to either listen on a socket port
(using the Linux kernel) *or* use tuntap directly -- the application code
remains the same. The definition of `main` just adds a new `stackv4` device
driver.

The `net` handler checks to see if it's building for a socket or direct network
stack. Crucially, both the socket and direct network stacks have a very similar
modular API which you can see in
[mirage/types/V1.mli](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/blob/1.1.0/types/V1.mli#L512).
This lets your applications be parameterized across either backend.

We then define the `dhcp` variable to configure the network stack to either use
DHCP or using the "default" IPv4 address (for convenience, MirageOS assigns a
default of `10.0.0.2` in this case; this is of course overridden for production
deployments). The definition of `stack` then uses `dhcp` and `net` accordingly
to set up the networking stack.


<br />
<div class="panel callout">
  <i class="fa fa-info fa-3x pull-left"> </i>
  <p>
    You will have noticed by this stage that <code>mirage configure</code>
    invokes OPAM to install any libraries that it needs. If your application
    needs some extra packages, you can use the optional <code>~packages</code>
    and <code>~libraries</code> arguments to <code>foreign</code> to add the
    extra OPAM packages and ocamlfind libraries. For example, you could modify
    the code above to add an <a
    href='https://github.com/mirage/mirage-http'>HTTP library</a>.
  </p>
</div>

#### Unix / Socket networking

Let's get the network stack compiling using the standard Unix sockets APIs
first.

```
$ cd stackv4
$ mirage configure -t unix --net socket
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-stackv4
Manager: connect
Manager: configuring
Manager: socket config currently ignored (TODO)
IP address: 0.0.0.0

```

This Unix application is now listening simultaneously on 53/UDP and 8080/TCP,
and will print to the console information about data received. Let's try, using
the commonly available _netcat_ `nc(1)` utility. From a different console
execute:

```
$ echo -n hello udp world | nc -unw1 127.0.0.1 53
[ 1 sec delay ]
$ echo -n hello tcp world | nc -nw1 127.0.0.1 8080
```

On the first console you should now see (each line in red, green and finally
yellow respectively if your console supports it):

```
UDP 127.0.0.1.59406 > 0.0.0.0.53: "hello udp world"
TCP 127.0.0.1.50997 > _.8080
read: 15 "hello tcp world"
```

#### Unix / MirageOS Stack with DHCP

Next, let's try using the direct MirageOS network stack. On a pre-Yosemite Mac,
be sure to install the [tuntap](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/) kernel module
before trying this.

Assuming you've got a DHCP server running:


```
$ cd stackv4
$ mirage configure -t unix --dhcp true --net direct
$ make
$ sudo ./mir-stackv4
Netif: connect unknown
Manager: connect
Manager: configuring
DHCP: start discovery

Sending DHCP broadcast (length 552)
DHCP: start discovery

Sending DHCP broadcast (length 552)
DHCP response:
input ciaddr 0.0.0.0 yiaddr 192.168.64.5
siaddr 192.168.64.1 giaddr 0.0.0.0
chaddr f2edd241cf3200000000000000000000 sname greyjay.mac.cl.cam.ac.uk file
DHCP: offer received: 192.168.64.5
DHCP options: Offer : DNS servers(192.168.64.1), Routers(192.168.64.1), Subnet mask(255.255.255.0), Lease time(85536), Server identifer(192.168.64.1)
Sending DHCP broadcast (length 552)
DHCP response:
input ciaddr 0.0.0.0 yiaddr 192.168.64.5
siaddr 192.168.64.1 giaddr 0.0.0.0
chaddr f2edd241cf3200000000000000000000 sname greyjay.mac.cl.cam.ac.uk file
DHCP: offer received
IPv4: 192.168.64.5
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateways: [192.168.64.1]
ARP: sending gratuitous from 192.168.64.5
DHCP offer received and bound to 192.168.64.5 nm 255.255.255.0 gw [192.168.64.1]
Manager: configuration done
IP address: 192.168.64.5

```

The application starts up, issues a DHCP request and (eventually) receives a
response allocating an address -- in this case, `192.168.64.5`. Using that
address we can then trigger the application logic with some network input from
`nc(1)` in a separate terminal as before:


```
$ echo -n hello udp world | nc -unw1 192.168.64.5 53
$ echo -n hello tcp world | nc -nw1 192.168.64.5 8080
```

The original terminal reports the ARP transactions invoked by the stack, and
then reports the input received over UDP and TCP as previously:

```
ARP responding to: who-has 192.168.64.5?
UDP 192.168.64.1.61367 > 192.168.64.5.53: "hello udp world"
ARP: transmitting probe -> 192.168.64.1
ARP: updating 192.168.64.1 -> 12:dd:b1:3a:68:64
TCP 192.168.64.1.51631 > _.8080
read: 15 "hello tcp world"
```

#### Unix / MirageOS Stack with static IP addresses

__N.B.__ _This is described below on Linux for Ubuntu 14.04. It was known to
work on pre-Yosemite Mac OSX, but has not been tested on Yosemite where the new
`vmnet` framework replaces `tuntap`._

By default, if we do not use DHCP with a `direct` network stack, Mirage will
configure the stack to use the `tap0` interface with an address of `10.0.0.2`.
Verify that you have an existing `tap0` interface by reviewing `$ sudo ip
link show`; if you do not, load the tuntap kernel module (`$ sudo modprobe tun`)
and create a `tap0` interface owned by you (`$ sudo tunctl -u $USER -t tap0`).
Bring `tap0` up using `$ sudo ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 up`, then:

```
$ cd stackv4
$ mirage configure -t unix --dhcp false --net direct
$ make
$ ./mir-stackv4
Netif: plugging into tap0 with mac c2:9d:56:19:d7:2c
Netif: connect tap0
Manager: connect
Manager: configuring
Manager: Interface to 10.0.0.2 nm 255.255.255.0 gw [10.0.0.1]

ARP: sending gratuitous from 10.0.0.2
Manager: configuration done
IP address: 10.0.0.2
```

Now you should be able to ping the unikernel's interface:

```
$ ping 10.0.0.2

You will see the ARP request being handled in the unikernel's terminal:

```
ARP responding to: who-has 10.0.0.2?
ARP: transmitting probe -> 10.0.0.1
ARP: updating 10.0.0.1 -> 6a:a8:fe:89:3c:67
```

Finally, you can then execute the same `nc(1)` commands as before (modulo the
target IP address of course!) to interact with the running unikernel:

```
$ echo -n hello udp world | nc -unw1 10.0.0.2 53
$ echo -n hello tcp world | nc -nw1 10.0.0.2 8080
```

And you will see the same output in the unikernel's terminal:

```
ARP responding to: who-has 10.0.0.2?
UDP 10.0.0.1.58784 > 10.0.0.2.53: "hello udp world"
ARP: transmitting probe -> 10.0.0.1
ARP: updating 10.0.0.1 -> ee:85:43:d5:d9:4d
TCP 10.0.0.1.47329 > _.8080
read: 15 "hello tcp world"
ARP: timeout 10.0.0.1
```

(The last line will be displayed after a delay dependent on the ARP timeout
setting.)

#### Xen

At this point, recompiling a Xen unikernel is pretty straightforward. The
configuration file already disables the socket-based job if a Xen compilation is
detected, leaving just the OCaml TCP/IP stack.

```
$ mirage configure -t xen --dhcp true
$ make
```

You will need to configure an appropriate Xen
[network bridge](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Networking) to connect to this.
The `mirage configure` command will guess the name of the bridge or openvswitch
to use based on the configuration of the build host. The generated `stackv4.xl`
will look like this:

```
# Generated by Mirage (Tue, 11 Aug 2015 21:05:57 GMT).

name = 'stackv4'
kernel = '/root/djs55/mirage-skeleton/stackv4/mir-stackv4.xen'
builder = 'linux'
memory = 256
on_crash = 'preserve'

disk = [  ]

# if your system uses openvswitch then either edit /etc/xen/xl.conf and set
#     vif.default.script="vif-openvswitch"
# or add "script=vif-openvswitch," before the "bridge=" below:
vif = [ 'bridge=xenbr0' ]
```

This tells Xen to bring up the virtual network interface and add it to the
`xenbr0` bridge. Depending on the dom0 interface configuration, usually
specified in `/etc/network/interfaces`, this will be brought up with a static IP
address or with a DHCP address. For example, in the Mirage Ubuntu 14.04
[Vagrant VM](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-vagrant-vms/), the following lines
are uncommented:

```
(network-script network-bridge)
(vif-script vif-bridge)
```

And the bridge interface is configured in `/etc/network/interfaces` as:

```
auto xenbr0
iface xenbr0 inet dhcp
  bridge_ports eth0
```

Finally, you can manually inspect the generated `main.ml` file to see what's
happening under the hood with the functor applications.

Now that we've covered the basics of configuration, block devices and
networking, let's get the real MirageOS website up and running with a
[networked application](/wiki/mirage-www).
