## Packaging with jbuilder and topkg

This post describes the current state-of-the-art in building and releasing
Mirage libraries with
[jbuilder](https://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder) (to build)
and
[topkg](https://github.com/dbuenzli/topkg) (to release).

### Goals

We wish to

- make development and releasing of individual components as quick and as easy
  as possible
- use a similar structure across the Mirage suite of components to make it
  easier for new people (and automated tools) to work across more than one
  component at a time

### The tools

We make heavy use of the following tools:

- [opam](https://github.com/ocaml/opam): defines a notion of a package, with versioned dependencies on other
  packages inside a package repository.
  We use this to ensure that we have a compatible set of component versions installed
  for our current project.
- [jbuilder](https://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder): a build tool (like `make`) which knows how to build OCaml code
  incrementally and really quickly.
- [topkg](https://github.com/dbuenzli/topkg): a release tool which assists with tagging and uploading artefacts
  to github.

Internally we make heavy use of
[ocamlfind](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)
but this is wrapped by jbuilder and opam.

### Conventions

We adopt the following conventions:

- we don't use opam's `depopts` to specify sub-libraries. Instead we create
  multiple `opam` packages via multiple `<name>.opam` files in the same repo.
  See [rgrinberg](http://rgrinberg.com/posts/optional-dependencies-considered-harmful/)'s
  post for a rationale
- we prefer to use the same name for both the `ocamlfind` package and the `opam` package. This is to avoid misunderstandings over whether you need to type `mirage-types.lwt` or `mirage-types-lwt` in the current context.
- we write `CHANGES.md` entries in the same style, to ensure they are parseable
  by `topkg`
- we do not enable warnings as errors in the repo; instead we turn these on for
  local developer builds only. This is to prevent released versions from breaking
  when a future compiler version is released.

### Package structure

A Mirage library should have

- `CHANGES.md`: containing a log of user-visible changes in each release.
  For example consider [mirage-tcpip.3.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/blob/v3.1.2/CHANGES.md):
  it has a markdown `###` prefix before each release version and the date in
  `(YYYY-MM-DD)` form.
- `LICENSE.md`: describing the conditions under which the code can be used
  (the Mirage standard license is ISC).
  For example [mirage-tcpip.3.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/blob/v3.1.2/LICENSE).
- `README.md`: describing what the code is for and linking to examples / docs /
  CI status. For example [mirage-tcpip.3.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip/blob/v3.1.2/README.md).
- one `<name>.opam` file per opam package defined in the repo.
  For example [mirage-block.1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block/blob/1.1.0/mirage-block.opam)
  and [mirage-block-lwt.1.1.0](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block/blob/1.1.0/mirage-block-lwt.opam).
  These should have a github pages `doc:` link in order that `topkg` can detect
  the upstream repo.
- The opam file specifies all direct dependencies are specified. Sometimes
  direct dependencies are included by transitivity, which is not very stable
  and could break the package in the future if one of the transitive dependencies
  is updated
- `Makefile`: contains `jbuilder` invocations including the `--dev` argument
  to enable warnings as errors for local builds.
  For example [mirage-block.3.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block/blob/1.1.0/Makefile)
- `pkg/pkg.ml`: contains the glue between jbuilder and topkg.
  For example [mirage-block.3.1.2](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block/blob/1.1.0/pkg/pkg.ml).
- one or more `jbuild` files: these describe how to build the libraries, executables
  and tests of your project.
  For example [mirage-block-unix.2.8.1/lib/jbuild](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-unix/blob/v2.8.1/lib/jbuild)
  links the main library against OCaml and C,
  while [mirage-block-unix.2.8.1/lib_test/jbuild](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-unix/blob/v2.8.1/lib_test/jbuild)
  defines 2 executables and associates one with an alias `runtest`, triggered by
  `make test` in the root.
- create an empty `doc/doc.odocl`. This is (hopefully only temporary) needed to
  release the documentation.


### Developing changes

It should be sufficient to

- `git clone` the repo
- `opam pin add <name> . -n`: to use the local opam metadata (in case it has changed
  from the last released version)
- `opam install --deps-only <name>`: to install any required dependencies

and then

- `make`: to perform an incremental build

### Releasing changes

Mirage releases are published via github. First log into your account and create
a github API token if you haven't already. Store it in a file (e.g. `~/.github/token`).
If on a multi-user machine, ensure the privileges are set to prevent other users
from reading it.

Before releasing anything it's a good idea to review the outstanding issues.
Perhaps some can be closed already? Maybe a `CHANGES.md` entry is missing?

When ready to go, create a branch from `master` and edit the `CHANGES.md` file
to list the interesting changes made since the last release. Make a PR for this
update. The CI will run which is a useful final check that the code still builds
and the tests still pass.
(It's
ok to skip this if the CI was working fine a few moments ago when you merged
another PR).

When the `CHANGES.md` PR is merged, pull it into your local `master` branch.

Read `topkg help release` to have an overview of the full release workflow.
You need to install `odoc`, `topkg-jbuilder` and `opam-publish` to be installed.
Run `opam-publish` once to generate a release token.

Type:

```
topkg tag
```
-- topkg will extract the latest version from the `CHANGES.md` file, perform
version substitutions and create a local tag.

Type:

```
topkg distrib
```
-- topkg will create a release tarball.

Install `odoc,` topkg-jbuilder Type:


```
topkg publish
```
-- topkg will push the tag, create a release and upload the release tarball.
It will also build the docs and push them online.

If you have the [multi-package release rules](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block/blob/master/Makefile#L12) in your Makefile,
and assumning that you have a clone on `ocaml/opam-repository` in `../opam-repository`, you can then type:

```
make opam-pkg
```

-- this will add new files in your opam-repository clone. `git commit` and push them to your fork on GitHub
and open a new pull-request.

If you only have one package in your repository, you can simply write:

```
topkg tag && topkg bistro
```
