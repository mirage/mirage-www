If you're familiar with the using the command line, the best way to learn about Mirage is to try out the [installation instructions](http://openmirage.org/wiki/install) for yourself!

!! What is Mirage and why is it important?

Most applications that run in the cloud aren't optimised to do so. They  make assumptions about the underlying operating system, and as a result are affected by underlying vulnerabilities and bloat. Compartmentalisation of large servers into smaller [virtual machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) has significantly reduced the costs involved in starting and scaling many online applications and businesses. This has been great but even though many of those virtual machines are single-purpose, they contain complete operating systems running large, complex applications like web-servers. This means a large part of the footprint is unused and unnecessary, which is both costly and a security risk due to the larger attack surface.

Mirage represents a new approach where only the necessary components of the OS are included and compiled along with the application into a [unikernel](http://nymote.org/docs/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf). This results in highly efficient and extremely lean [appliances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance), with much smaller attack surfaces. These appliances can be deployed directly to the cloud and embedded devices, with the benefits of reduced costs and increased security and scalability.

!! How does Mirage work?

<a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/hypervisor.html"><img style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" src="/graphics/Xen-Panda-Ecosystem-1.png"></img></a>

Mirage is a unikernel OS for constructing secure, high-performance network applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms. It works by treating the [Xen hypervisor](http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/hypervisor.html) as a stable hardware platform, allowing us to focus on high-performance protocol implementations without worrying about having to support the thousands of device drivers found in a traditional OS.

Code is developed in a high-level functional programming language (OCaml) on a desktop OS such as Linux or Mac OSX, and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised appliance unikernel. These unikernels run directly on Xen hypervisor APIs. Since the Xen powers most public clouds such as [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2), [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/), and many others, Mirage lets your servers run more cheaply, securely and faster in any Xen based cloud or hosting service.

Mirage is built in the OCaml language with syntax extensions and [35+ libraries](https://github.com/mirage) which map directly to operating system constructs when being compiled for production deployment. As such, Mirage includes clean-slate functional implementations of protocols ranging from TCP/IP, DNS, SSH, Openflow (switch/controller), HTTP, XMPP and Xen inter-VM transports.


!! Where will Mirage be useful?

An example of a current Mirage appliance is this website
<<<<<<< HEAD
which is a completely self-hosted site, deployed on the public cloud and
running directly on the Xen hypervisor (in this case, on
Amazon EC2). Such appliances could be auto-configured and deployed directly
to the public cloud (e.g. Rackspace or Amazon EC2) or pushed to embedded
devices. There is also
[http://decks.openmirage.org](http://decks.openmirage.org), where separate
Mirage unikernels are being used to present slides for conferences.  These
are both example of how Mirage is working right now and below are examples
of what we can do in the future.

!!! Self-scaling architecture

We can create auto-scaling web-servers with very small footprints.  These
would be cheaper to run than current solutions due to the small size but
they would also be highly elastic.  If a sudden spike in traffic occurs, the
web-servers can be configured to create and deploy copies of themselves to
service the demand.  This auto-scaling happens so quickly that an incoming
connection can trigger the creation of new server and the *new server* can
then handle that request before it times out (which is on the order of
milliseconds). When the demand dies down again, these web-servers can
automatically shut themselves down. Since these machines boot fast we can be
more elastic, raising and lowering capacity to precisely meet demand and
therefore only spending what we actually need when we really need it.

!!! Deployment to embedded devices

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukew/6171377827/"><img style="float:left; margin-right: 15px;" src="/graphics/device-love.jpg"></img></a>

Using Mirage, we can also create appliances that can run on embedded devices.
Such appliances can be deployed into small devices that are scattered
around your home, for example in plant pots to measure moisture levels to
chemical sensors
in your fridge, which tell you exactly what has gone off.  You could access
the data from these sensors via a web-sever appliance, which is also
deployed locally in your home on a device like a
[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org).
Installing additional applications into your Raspberry Pi appliance can be a
a simple 1-click operation, allowing you to share your data or compare with
others.  Creating a home-based network like this ensures you're not affected
by any upstream connectivity issues and that your data remains within your
control.

This same scenario can be deployed into a enterprise environment where
sensors around a building can monitor environmental conditions, adjust
lighting and many other things.  When additional computation is required,
more appliances can automatically be created on a cloud provider for the
short duration that they're needed.

Overall, Mirage provides substantial benefits in terms of increased
efficiency and safety and is ideal for deploying to both the public could
and embedded devices.  Together with [Signpost](http://nymote.org/software/signpost) and [Irminsule](http://nymote.org/software/irminsule), Mirage
forms a core piece of the Nymote toolstack to power the coming wave of
[Internet of Things devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things).
