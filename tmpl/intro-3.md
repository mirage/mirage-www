[MirageOS 1.0](https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage10) was created in December 2013, and it was updated to [MirageOS 2.0](https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release) in July 2014. The latest version, [MirageOS 3.0](https://mirage.io/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release), was released in February 2017. Since, then multiple minor releases have been done (TODO: link to the last one? Risk: it can be outdated soon) ; TODO: also we plan to release Mirage 4.0 in 2021.
