*In Theory*

Unless you are familiar with Xen's source code, there is little chance
that you've ever heard of the *vchan* library or
protocol. Documentation about it is very scarce: a description can be
found on vchan's
[public header file](http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=blob;f=xen/include/public/io/libxenvchan.h;hb=HEAD),
that I quote here for convenience:

> Originally borrowed from the
> [Qubes OS Project](http://www.qubes-os.org), this code (i.e. libvchan)
> has been substantially rewritten [...]
> This is a library for inter-domain communication.  A standard Xen ring

This protocol is using shared memory for inter-domain communication,
that is, between two VMs residing in the same Xen host, and uses Xen's
mechanisms -- more specifically,
[ring buffers](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1160234&seqNum=3)
and
[event channels](http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=blob;f=tools/libxc/xenctrl.h;h=f2cebafc9ddd4815ffc73fcf9e0d292b1d4c91ff;hb=HEAD#l934)
-- in order to achieve its aims. *Datagram-based interface* simply
means that the
[interface](http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=blob;f=tools/libvchan/libxenvchan.h;h=6365d36a06f8c8f56454724cefc4c2f1d39beba2;hb=HEAD)
ressemble the one of UDP, although there is support for stream based
communication (like TCP) as well.

Over the last two months or so, I worked on a
[pure OCaml implementation](http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan) of
this library, meaning that mirage based unikernels can now take full
advantage of *vchan* to communicate with neighboring VMs! If your
endpoint -- a linux VM or another unikernel -- is on the same host, it
is much more fast and efficient to use vchan rather than the network
stack (although unfortunately, it is currently uncompatible with
existing programs written against the `socket` library under UNIX or
the `Flow` module of Mirage). If also provide a better level of
security compared to network sockets as messages will never leave the
host's shared memory.

*Building the vchan echo domain*

Provided that you have a Xen enabled machine, do the following from
dom0:

{{
    opam install mirari mirage-xen mirage vchan
}}

This will install the library and its dependencies. `mirari` is
necessary to build the *echo unikernel*:

{{
    git clone git://github.com/mirage/ocaml-vchan
    cd test
    mirari configure --xen --no-install
    mirari build --xen
    sudo mirari run --xen
}}

This will boot a `vchan echo domain` for dom0, with connection
parameters stored in xenstore at `/local/domain/<domid>/data/vchan`,
where `<domid>` is the domain id of the vchan echo domain. The echo
domain is simply an unikernel hosting a vchan server accepting
connections from dom0, and echo'ing everything that is sent to it.

The command `xl list` will give you the domain id of the echo
server.

*Building the vchan CLI from Xen's sources*

You can try it using a vchan client that can be found in Xen's sources
at `tools/libvchan`: Just type `make` in this directory. It will
compile the executable `vchan-node2` that you can use to connect to
our freshly created echo domain:

{{
    ./vchan-node2 client <domid>/local/domain/<domid>/data/vchan
}}

If everything goes well, what you type in there will be echoed.

You can obtain the full API documentation for *ocaml-vchan* by doing a
`cd ocaml-vchan && make doc`. If you are doing network programming
under UNIX, vchan's interface will not surprise you. If you are
already using vchan for a C project, you will see that the OCaml API
is nearly identical to what you are used to.

Please let us know if you use or plan to use this library in any way!
If you need tremedous speed or more security, this might fit your
needs.
