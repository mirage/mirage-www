Last summer we announced the beta release of a clean-slate implementation of
TLS in pure OCaml, alongside a [series of blog posts][om-tls] that described
the libraries and the thinking behind them.  It took two hackers six months
— starting on [the beach][mirleft-map] —  to get the stack to that point and
their [demo server][tls-demo] is still going strong. Since then, the team has
continued working and recently [presented][31c3] at the 31st Chaos
Communication Congress.

The authors are putting their stack to the test again and this time they've
built a **[Bitcoin Piñata][tls-pinata]**! Essentially, they've hidden a
private key to a bitcoin address within a Unikernel running on Xen. If you're
able to smash your way in, then you get to keep the spoils.

There's more context around this in my [Piñata post][ac-post] and you can see
the details on the [site itself][tls-pinata]. Remember that the codebase is
[all open][mirleft] (as well as [issues][tls-issues]) so there's nothing to
reverse engineer. Have fun!
