Now that Mirage OS is rapidly converging on Developer Preview Release 1, we took it for a first public outing at [OSCON'13](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/). The O'Reilly Open Source Conference, OSCON is in its 15th year and is a meeting place for developers and innovators, business people and investors. It was a great opportunity to show Mirage OS off to some of the movers and shakers in the Open Source world.

Partly because Mirage OS is about synthesising extremely specialised guest kernels from high-level code, and partly because both Anil and I are constitutionally incapable of taking the easy way out, we self-hosted the slide deck on Mirage: after much last minute hacking -- on content rather than Mirage OS itself I should add! -- we built a self-contained microkernel of the talk.

This was what you might call a "full stack" presentation: the custom microkernel ran (flawlessly!) a type-safe OCaml TCP/IP stack supporting an OCaml HTTP framework that served slides rendered using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). The slide deck, including the turbo-boosted screencast of the slide deck compilation, is hosted as another Mirage OS VM at <http://decks.openmirage.org/> -- we hope to add more slide decks there soon! The source code for all this is in the [mirage-decks github repository](http://github.com/mirage/mirage-decks).

The talk went down pretty well -- given we were in a graveyard slot on Friday after many people had left, attendance was fairly high (around 20), and the feedback scores have been positive (averaging 4.7/5) with comments including "_excellent content and well done_" and "_one of the most excited projects I heard about_" (though we are suspicious that just refers to Anil's usual high-energy presentation style...).
 
Probably the most interesting chat after the talk concerned combining the Mirage unikernel techniques with the [Rust]() runtime, with the Rust authors at Mozilla. But perhaps the most surprising feedback was when Anil and I were stopped in the street while walking back from some well-earned sushi, by a cyclist who loudly declared that he'd really enjoyed the talk and thought it was a really exciting project -- never done something that achieved that level of public acclaim before :)

All-in-all OSCON'13 was a fun event and definitely one that we look forward returning to with a more mature version of Mirage OS, to build on the momentum begun this year!
